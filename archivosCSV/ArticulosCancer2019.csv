Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060646757

Here, we examine the effects of county-level factors on guideline-concordant breast-cancer screening behaviors in Latinas and NLWs. Design: Latinas (N=108) and NLW women (N=132) aged >40 years, residing in two adjacent rural, medically underserved counties in eastern Washington State, completed a baseline questionnaire on mammography utilization and demographics. Main Outcomes: Differences in socioeconomic variables and knowledge of screening practices were examined by ethnicity and county of residence. Predictors of having had a mammogram within the past two years were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Ethnicity was not associated with having a guideline-concordant mammogram; however, age (odds ratio [OR]=1.04, 95%CI:1.01-1.08); having >12 years of education (OR=2.09, 95%CI:1.16-3.79); having a regular clinic for health care (OR=2.22, 95%CI:1.05-4.70); having had a prior clinical breast exam (OR=5.07, 95%CI:1.71-15.02), and county of residence (OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.18-4.37) were all associated with having had a guideline-concordant mammogram. Conclusions: County of residence and having had a prior CBE were strong predictors of screening utilization.

This Cochrane review, published originally in 2012, was updated in 2017. Methods: We updated our search of Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL to December 2017. Only RCTs investigating local anesthetics (by any route) or regional anesthesia versus any combination of systemic (opioid or non-opioid) analgesia in adults or children, reporting any pain outcomes beyond three months were included. Data were extracted independently by at least two authors, who also appraised methodological quality with Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ assessment and pooled data in surgical subgroups. We pooled studies across different follow-up intervals. As summary statistic, we reported the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and calculated the number needed to benefit (NNTB). We considered classical, Bayesian alternatives to our evidence synthesis. We explored heterogeneity and methodological bias. Results: 40 new and seven ongoing studies, identified in this update, brought the total included RCTs to 63. We were only able to synthesize data from 39 studies enrolling 3027 participants in a balanced design. Evidence synthesis favored regional anesthesia for thoracotomy (OR 0.52 [0.32 to 0.84], moderate-quality evidence), breast cancer surgery (OR 0.43 [0.28 to 0.68], low-quality evidence), and cesarean section (OR 0.46, [0.28 to 0.78], moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis favored continuous infusion of local anesthetic after breast cancer surgery (OR 0.24 [0.08 to 0.69], moderate-quality evidence), but was inconclusive after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (OR 0.20, [0.04 to 1.09], low-quality evidence). Conclusions: Regional anesthesia reduces the risk of PPP. Small study size, performance, null, and attrition bias considerably weakened our conclusions. We cannot extrapolate to other interventions or to children. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059779093

Classification performance was assessed by biopsy condition in the task of distinguishing between lesion types using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) as performance metric. Superiority and equivalence testing of differences in AUCROC between biopsy conditions were conducted using Bonferroni-Holm-adjusted significance levels. Distributions for most nonsize features for each lesion type failed to show a statistically significant difference between biopsy conditions. Fourteen features outperformed random guessing in classification. Their differences in AUCROC by biopsy condition failed to reach statistical significance, but we were unable to prove equivalence using a margin of ΔAUCROC = ± 0.10.

This imaging technique is based on the principle of computed tomography. Due to the use of a dangerous ionizing radiation, the ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) principle should be respected, aiming at minimizing the radiation dose to obtain an adequate examination. Thus, a noise filtering method is a fundamental step to achieve the ALARA principle, as the noise level of the image increases as the radiation dose is reduced, making it difficult to analyze the image. In our work, a double denoising approach for DBT is proposed, filtering in both projection (prereconstruction) and image (postreconstruction) domains. First, in the prefiltering step, methods were used for filtering the Poisson noise. To reconstruct the DBT projections, we used the filtered backprojection algorithm. Then, in the postfiltering step, methods were used for filtering Gaussian noise. Experiments were performed on simulated data generated by open virtual clinical trials (OpenVCT) software and on a physical phantom, using several combinations of methods in each domain. Our results showed that double filtering (i.e., in both domains) is not superior to filtering in projection domain only. By investigating the possible reason to explain these results, it was found that the noise model in DBT image domain could be better modeled by a Burr distribution than a Gaussian distribution. Finally, this important contribution can open a research direction in the DBT denoising problem. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Final",,2-s2.0-85062716975

We investigated the factors affecting postmastectomy reconstruction and IBR rates. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified women with clinical stage I-II breast cancer who underwent mastectomy at our public hospital, Los Angeles County Medical Center, and our private cancer center, Keck Hospital of USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to study predictors of IBR and any breast reconstruction. Results: Of 293 mastectomy patients, the rate of any breast reconstruction at the private cancer (56.6%) center was higher than that at the public hospital (36.2%). IBR rates for the private cancer center (93.6%) and for patients with private insurance were higher than for the public hospital (40.8%) and likewise for those without insurance (86.7% versus 45.5%). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IBR at our private cancer center were 22.96 times higher than that at our public hospital.

While efforts are underway to grow Zambia's palliative care system, the most recent situational analysis of palliative care in Zambia, conducted in 2008, revealed substantial gaps in availability. Methods: To provide an updated appraisal of breast and cervical cancer services in Zambia, including palliative care, we conducted a nationwide provincial and tertiary hospital survey. All 9 provincial hospitals and the University Teaching Hospital and Cancer Diseases Hospital in Lusaka Province participated (N = 11). The survey was conducted between August 2014 and January 2015 and administered in-person at each facility. Data regarding the availability of inpatient, outpatient, and community-based palliative care services, palliative medications, and psychosocial supports was obtained at each facility. The reported results are descriptive in nature. Results: Although the need for palliative care services was recognized, many facilities (64%) lack palliative care policies and only 18% offer palliative care in a coordinated program. The majority of services are only available to inpatients and rarely include community-based programs. While all facilities had adequate supplies of acetaminophen, 82% reported unavailability of codeine and 45% reported no access to oral morphine. Conclusions: This assessment confirms the dearth of palliative care services across Zambia. Less than half of its provincial hospitals offer community- or home-based services and only 55% offer opioid analgesics. Immediate and substantial improvements in policy, drug procurement and distribution, and service expansion are needed to ensure high-quality palliative care is available throughout Zambia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85062260346

LncRNA FGF13-AS1 has been identified as one of the 25 downregulated lncRNAs in breast cancer through analyzing data from two cohorts and TCGA by another group of our lab. In this study, we report that FGF13-AS1 expression is decreased in breast cancer tissue compared with corresponding normal tissue, and the downregulation of FGF13-AS1 is associated with poor prognosis. Functional studies show that FGF13-AS1 inhibits breast cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion by impairing glycolysis and stemness properties. Mechanistically, FGF13-AS1 reduces the half-life of c-Myc (Myc) mRNA by binding RNA-binding proteins, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding proteins (IGF2BPs) and disrupting the interaction between IGF2BPs and Myc mRNA. Furthermore, Myc transcriptionally inhibits FGF13-AS1, forming a feedback loop in this signaling pathway. These results reveal for the first time that FGF13-AS1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting glycolysis and stemness properties of breast cancer cells, and the FGF13-AS1/IGF2BPs/Myc feedback loop could be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer patients. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85062222119

Methods: From April 2014 to June 2015, 124 women with dense breasts and intermediate to high breast cancer risk were recruited for screening with FFDM, DBT, and ABUS. Readers used FFDM and DBT in clinical practice and received ABUS training prior to study initiation. FFDM or DBT were first interpreted alone by two independent readers and then with ABUS. All recalled women underwent diagnostic workup with at least one year of follow-up. Recall rates were compared using the sign test; differences in outcomes were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of 121 women with complete follow-up, all had family (35.5%) or personal (20.7%) history of breast cancer, or both (43.8%). Twenty-four women (19.8%) were recalled by at least one modality. Recalls increased from 5.0% to 13.2% (p = 0.002) when ABUS was added to FFDM and from 3.3% to 10.7% (p = 0.004) when ABUS was added to DBT. Findings recalled by both readers were more likely to result in a recommendation for short term follow-up imaging or tissue biopsy compared to findings recalled by only one reader (100% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.041). The cancer detection rate was 8.3 per 1000 screens (1/121); mode of detection: FFDM and DBT. Conclusions: Adding ABUS significantly increased the recall rate of both FFDM and DBT screening.

Squalamine alone inhibited progression of MCF-7 tumors lacking HER2 overexpression, and squalamine combined with trastuzumab elicited marked inhibition of MCF-7/HER2 growth exceeding that of trastuzumab alone. MCF-7/HER-2 cells secrete higher levels of VEGF than MCF-7 cells, but squalamine elicited no growth inhibition of either MCF-7/HER-2 or MCF-7 cells in vitro. However, squalamine did stop growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and reduced VEGF-induced endothelial tube-like formations in vitro. These effects correlated with blockade of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and stress fiber assembly in HUVECs. Thus, squalamine effectively inhibits growth of breast cancers with or without HER-2-overexpression, an effect due in part to blockade of tumor-associated angiogenesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061800736

Retrospective review identified high risk women who had ovarian risk reducing surgery over the past decade and surgical outcomes, pathology, pre-operative screening results, and pre-/post-operative cancer diagnoses were evaluated. One hundred and eighty-three high-risk women had risk reducing surgery at a mean age of 50.1 years and with a mean BMI of 28.9 kg/m2 at the time of surgery. Most women (103; 56.3%) had a strong family history of cancer concerning for a hereditary syndrome without an identified mutation, 35.5% of women carried a known deleterious mutation and 7.7% of women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer. The most common procedure was a risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy (RRBSO, 89.1%). All women underwent the Sectioning and Extensively Examining the Fimbriated End (SEE-FIM) pathology protocol which found two (1.1%) invasive ovarian cancers (one ovarian/tubal carcinosarcoma, one granulosa cell ovarian cancer), three (1.6%) serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), and one (1.1%) invasive fallopian tube cancer. Subsequent cancer diagnoses included one (0.5%) primary peritoneal cancer, four (2.2%) DCIS, and seven (3.8%) invasive breast cancers. Ultimately, among all high-risk women undergoing RR surgery, about 3.3% were diagnosed with a STIC or an ovarian cancer none of which were identified on screening. All STIC and tubal cancers were diagnosed in women with BRCA mutations (6.6% rate for this group). © 2019","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060936514

Several studies suggest that the CTRA may also be down-regulated in association with some positive psychological states, particularly eudaimonic well-being. However, it is not clear if the link between inter-individual differences in the CTRA and eudaimonic well-being can be extended to intra-individual change. Using a standardized mindfulness-based intervention, the current study tested whether mindfulness-related increases in eudaimonic well-being related to intra-individual reduction in the CTRA in a sample of younger breast cancer survivors. Methods: Participants were 22 women who had been diagnosed and treated for early-stage breast cancer at or before age 50 (M age = 46.6 years) and had no evidence of active disease. Women completed self-report questionnaires and provided peripheral blood samples before and after a 6-week mindfulness meditation intervention. Regression analyses were used to quantify associations between the magnitude of change in eudaimonic well-being and the magnitude of change in the global CTRA score. Results: Women reported significant increases in eudaimonic well–being and showed decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory subcomponent of the CTRA from pre- to post-intervention. The magnitude of increase in eudaimonic well-being was associated with the magnitude of decrease in the composite CTRA score, and this relationship was driven primarily by increased expression of the antiviral/antibody-related CTRA subcomponent. While the intervention was also associated with reduced depressive symptoms, there was no association between change in depressive symptoms and change in the overall CTRA composite score or either of its subcomponents. Conclusions: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that eudaimonic well-being may be an important mechanism in interventions aimed at enhancing health in vulnerable groups, and contribute to our understanding of how psychological well-being may influence physical health in cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85060532946

Recent studies have demonstrated that artemisinin (ART) displays anti-tumor activity. Using a mouse breast cancer model, we investigated the effects of ART in vitro and in vivo to determine how it influences the anti-tumor immune response. Methods: We measured the proliferation and apoptosis of 4T1 cells in vitro after ART treatment by MTT assay and FACS. To examine the effects of ART in vivo, tumor volumes and survival rates were measured in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. FACS was used to determine the frequencies of Tregs, MDSCs, CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells, and CTLs in the tumors and spleens of the mice. mRNA levels of the transcription factors T-bet and FOXP3 and cytokines IFN-γ TNF-α TGF-β and IL-10 were also determined by real-time RT-PCR. ELISA was used to measure TGF-β protein levels in the cell culture supernatants. Results: ART supplementation significantly increased 4T1 cell apoptosis and decreased TGF-β levels in vitro. ART also impeded tumor growth in 4T1 TB mice and extended their survival. MDSC and Treg frequencies significantly decreased in the 4T1 TB mice after ART treatment while CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells and CTLs significantly increased. ART significantly increased T-bet, IFN-γ and TNF-α mRNA levels within the tumor and significantly decreased TGF-β mRNA levels. Conclusion: ART supplementation hindered 4T1 tumor growth in vivo by promoting T cell activation and quelling immunosuppression from Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor. © 2019 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061812569

Women 18 and over with one or two foci of breast pain and no concurrent breast symptoms were included. 944 patients met criteria. We recorded the imaging work-up, presence and type of finding at the site of pain, BI-RADS® assessment, and pathological outcomes. Subsequent imaging and clinical follow up was recorded. Results: Imaging evaluation consisted of sonogram alone in 286 women, mammogram alone in 231 women, and both in 427 women. 113 women had an imaging finding at the site of pain; 103 were designated benign or probably benign. 12 biopsies of corresponding findings were performed: 9 benign, 1 invasive lobular carcinoma, 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 ductal carcinoma in situ. All three malignancies were seen mammographically; 2 had an ultrasound correlate. At initial evaluation, 4 incidental breast cancers were diagnosed remote from the site of FBP. All were seen on mammogram and 2 of 4 had an ultrasound correlate. On follow up evaluation, 9 cancers were diagnosed at the site of pain and 13 incidental cancers were diagnosed.

Assessment of tumor proliferation in a clinical setting is a highly subjective and labor-intensive task. Previous efforts to automate tumor proliferation assessment by image analysis only focused on mitosis detection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario, automatic mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs) and an automatic method should be able to produce a tumor proliferation score given a WSI as input. To address this, we organized the TUmor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation scores from WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing breast cancer histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent evaluation, only the ground truth for the training dataset was provided to the challenge participants. The first task of the challenge was to predict mitotic scores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation by a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based PAM50 proliferation scores from the WSI. The best performing automatic method for the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa score of κ = 0.567, 95% CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the ground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a Spearman's correlation coefficient of r = 0.617, 95% CI [0.581 0.651] with the ground truth. This was the first comparison study that investigated tumor proliferation assessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given the difficulty of the tasks and weakly-labeled nature of the ground truth. However, further research is needed to improve the practical utility of image analysis methods for this task. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85062515954

DDM-Madrid is a cross-sectional study that recruited 1403 premenopausal women in a breast radiodiagnosis unit of Madrid City Council. Information was collected with a questionnaire and plasma 25(OH)D was measured by solid-phase extraction on-line coupled to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Percent mammographic density was assessed using a semi-automated computer tool (DM-Scan). Multivariable linear regression models were used to quantify the associations, categorizing 25(OH)D levels (nmol/L) into 3 groups according to the cut-offs established by the US Endocrine Society. Models were adjusted for age, education, body mass index, age at menarche, parity, previous breast biopsies, family history of breast cancer, physical activity, energy intake, use of corticoids, hypercholesterolemia and day of sample extraction. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 49.4 + 18.9 nmol/L. Women with sufficient concentrations of 25(OH)D showed a slight decrease in mammographic density (β &gt;75nmol/L =-3.40; p = 0.037). No differences were observed according to women characteristics except for parity, where the protective effect of 25(OH)D was only seen among nulliparous (β &gt;75nmol/L =-13.00; p-heterogeneity = 0.006). In light of the protective effect of vitamin D on mammographic density and the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in our population, improving these levels could be an effective measure for the prevention of health problems related to the lack of this essential vitamin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85062385016

We discuss Bayesian meta-analytic summaries (posterior mean over a set of existing studies, posterior estimate in an existing study, posterior predictive mean in a new study) used to estimate diagnostic test parameters (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity) needed to calculate quality-adjusted life years in a decision model contextualizing PET, PET/CT, and CW. Results: The mean and predictive mean give similar estimates, but the latter displays greater uncertainty. Namely, PET/CT outperforms CW on average but may not do better than CW when implemented in future settings.

We used data from 43,570 Sister Study participants who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire at enrollment (2003–2009) and satisfied eligibility criteria. The Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) score was used to estimate diet-dependent acid load. Higher scores reflect greater consumption of protein and phosphorus, and lower consumption of potassium, calcium and magnesium. The association between PRAL and breast cancer was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. We identified 1,614 invasive breast cancers diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment (mean follow-up, 7.6 years). The highest PRAL quartile, reflecting greater acid-forming potential, was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 1.21 [95% CI, 1.04–1.41], p trend = 0.04). The association was more pronounced for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 1.67 [95% CI, 1.07–2.61], p trend = 0.03) and triple-negative breast cancer (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 2.20 [95% CI, 1.23–3.95], p trend = 0.02). Negative PRAL scores, representing consumption of alkaline diets, were associated with decreased risk of ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancer, compared to a PRAL score of 0 representing neutral pH. Higher diet-dependent acid load may be a risk factor for breast cancer while alkaline diets may be protective. Since PRAL scores are positively correlated with meat consumption and negatively correlated with fruit and vegetable intake, results also suggest that diets high in fruits and vegetables and low in meat may be protective against hormone receptor negative breast cancer. © 2018 UICC","Final",,2-s2.0-85058124855

In addition, the model produces estimates of quantities not as easily obtained from experiment such as velocity and stress field information throughout the fluid and on the cell membrane. This includes locations of maximum stress along the membrane wall. A sensitivity analysis shows that the model is capable of producing useful insights into various systems involving breast cancer cells. Current results suggest that dynamics taking place when cells are near other objects are most sensitive to membrane and cytoplasm elasticity, dynamics taking place when cells are not near other objects are most sensitive to cytoplasm viscosity, and dynamics are significantly affected by low membrane bending elasticity. These results suggest that continued calibration and application of this model can yield useful predictions in other similar systems. © 2019, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059563499

Methods: In the prospective Intact Percutaneous Excision registry study, women aged 31–86 years had removal of small invasive cancers, DCIS, or HRLs using image-guided 12–20 mm radiofrequency basket capture (MI excision). Second-pass 20 mm basket capture obtained shaved margins in cancer patients. Standard imaging (specimen, breast) and histologic criteria were applied. Patient data were registered in an Institutional Review Board approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant registry. Results: Of 282 registered patients, 124 had DCIS (n = 52) or invasive cancer (n = 72) and 160 had HRLs. Among cancer patients, 101 (81%) had clear histologic margins [average lesion size was 11 mm for both invasive cancers (4–20 mm) and DCIS (1.5–20 mm)]; 29 patients had re-excision (six despite clear margins). Among 160 HRLs, two were upgraded to DCIS and had MI excision. Two other HRL patients had subsequent standard surgical excision (no cancer found). Conclusion: For diminutive HRLs, DCIS, and invasive cancers, MI excision can achieve the same procedure goals as standard surgical excision. Because MI excision removes less tissue with small incisions, it may reduce the discomfort and expense associated with standard treatment. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061246059

The study was conducted to optimize the surgical resection of axilla in patients with negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) for the purpose of eradicating false-negative (FN) events of SLND. Methods: A total of 312 clinically node-negative patients without neoadjuvant therapy underwent SLND with indocyanine green (ICG), methylene blue and the combination of ICG and methylene blue. Axillary dissection was performed subsequently regardless of the status of SLN. Lymph nodes were sent for pathological examination separately by serial resection every 0.5 cm away from marginally visualized SLNs. Results: SLND was successfully conducted in 98.1% (306/312) of patients using methylene blue, ICG, and its combination. Further examination revealed 97 true-positive, 189 true-negative, and 13 FN results. The overall FNR was 11.8% (13/110).

Over the period 2008–2012, almost 9,000 new cancer cases were registered in older adults in the four populations, representing one-third of all cancer cases. Prostate and esophageal cancers were the leading cancer sites in older males, while breast, cervical and esophageal cancers were the most common among older females. Among younger people, Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were common. Over the past 20 years, incidence rates among older adults have increased in both sexes in Uganda and Zimbabwe while rates have stabilized among the younger age group. Among older adults, the largest rate increase was observed for breast cancer (estimated annual percentage change: 5% in each country) in females and for prostate cancer (6–7%) in males.

Upregulation of ST3Gal1 has been associated with worse prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the protein substrates of ST3Gal1 implicated in tumor progression remain elusive. In our study, we demonstrated that ST3GAL1-silencing significantly reduced tumor growth along with a notable decrease in vascularity of MCF7 xenograft tumors. We identified vasorin (VASN) which was shown to bind TGF-β1, as a potential candidate that links ST3Gal1 to angiogenesis. LC-MS/MS analysis of VASN secreted from MCF7, revealed that more than 80% of its O-glycans are sialyl-3T and disialyl-T. ST3GAL1-silencing or desialylation of VASN by neuraminidase enhanced its binding to TGF-β1 by 2- to 3-fold and thereby dampening TGF-β1 signaling and angiogenesis, as indicated by impaired tube formation of HUVECs, suppressed angiogenesis gene expression and reduced activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in HUVEC cells. Examination of 114 fresh primary breast cancer and their adjacent normal tissues showed that the expression levels of ST3Gal1 and TGFB1 were high in tumor part and the expression of two genes was positively correlated. Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter relapse-free survival for those with lower expression VASN, notably, the combination of low VASN with high ST3GAL1 yielded even higher risk of recurrence (p = 0.025, HR = 2.967, 95% CI = 1.14–7.67). Since TGF-β1 is known to transcriptionally activate ST3Gal1, our findings illustrated a feedback regulatory loop in which TGF-β1 upregulates ST3Gal1 to circumvent the negative impact of VASN. © 2018 The Authors.

Methods: Women ≥ 70 years of age with T1, ER+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) tumors undergoing BCT in 2010–2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Ten-year estimated mortality was calculated using the Suemoto index. The associations of clinicopathological features and mortality risk on receipt of RT were examined. Results: Overall, 323 patients with 327 cancers were identified. Median age was 75 years, median tumor size was 1 cm, and all were clinically node negative; 53.7% of patients received RT. RT usage decreased with age (73.6%, age 70–74 years; 49.5%, age 75–79 years; 33.3%, age 80–84 years; 10.7%, ≥ 85 years; p < 0.001). Within age groups, estimated mortality did not impact RT usage.

In the current study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of 2′-hydroxyflavanone (2HF) and RLIP inhibition in an array of triple-negative BC cell lines and an orthotopic mouse model of breast-to-lung metastasis. Compared to control treatment, RLIP inhibition reduced in-vitro cell viability and suppressed the migratory and invasive potential of BC cells. In-vitro studies showed that 2HF treatment reduced the expression of RLIP, KRAS, pERK, pSTAT3, and pP70S6K. Further, mice orthotopically implanted with lung-seeking luciferase-expressing TMD231 cells were treated with 2HF (50 mg/kg, b.w.), RLIP antisense (RAS; 5 mg/kg, b.w.), RLIP antibody (Rab; 5 mg/kg, b.w.) or a combination of 2HF + RAS + Rab. 2HF-, RAS-, and Rab-treated mice exhibited significantly lower primary tumor weight and reduced lung metastasis compared to control mice. Mice treated with a combination of 2HF + RAS + Rab exhibited no metastasis and significantly lower tumor weight than the single agent-treated mice.

Obesity-induced inflammation and elevated biosynthesis of estrogens, through aromatase-mediated metabolism of precursors, have been linked with hormone receptor positive (HP) postmenopausal BrCA but not previously associated with premenopausal BrCA risk. Thus, further delineation of the interaction of obesity, inflammation, and aromatase is required for the development of therapeutic treatment options. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of high fat diet (HFD)-induced inflammation on tumorigenesis in a model of pre and postmenopausal HP BrCA. Female PyMT/MMTV ovary intact and ovariectomized mice were fed low and HFD diets to examine the role of obesity-induced inflammation and hormone production in the development of HP BrCA. Tumor statistics for number, volume, weight, histopathology scoring and gene expression of macrophage and inflammatory mediators were measured in the AT and mammary gland at sacrifice. HFD feedings of ovary intact mice resulted in increased adiposity and tumorigenesis, indicated by increased primary tumor volume, multiplicity, tumor burden, and increased tumor progression represented by histopathological scoring. HFD-induced obesity significantly upregulated aromatase and macrophage marker expression in the AT (F4/80 and CD11c) and mammary gland (Mertk) in a premenopausal model of BrCA. Conversely, HFD feedings had no significant effect on tumorigenesis in a postmenopausal model of BrCA despite large increases in adiposity in ovariectomized mice; however, limitations within the model may have precluded any significant findings. This data suggests that obesity-induced increases in inflammation and hormone production, via aromatase expression, is associated with increases in tumorigenesis in a model of premenopausal HP BrCA in the PyMT/MMTV strain. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056126639

However, there is no specific inhibitor of DNA polymerases that is viable for cancer management. Through structure-based in silico screening of the ZINC database, we identified a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase δ. The discovered inhibitor, Zelpolib, is projected to bind to the active site of Pol δ when it is actively engaged in DNA replication through interactions with DNA template and primer. Zelpolib shows robust inhibition of Pol δ activity in reconstituted DNA replication assays. Under cellular conditions, Zelpolib is taken up readily by cancer cells and inhibits DNA replication in assays to assess global DNA synthesis or single-molecule bases by DNA fiber fluorography. In addition, we show that Zelpolib displays superior antiproliferative properties to methotrexate, 5-flourouracil, and cisplatin in triple-negative breast cancer cell line, pancreatic cancer cell line and platinum-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line. Pol δ is not only involved in DNA replication, it is also a key component in many DNA repair pathways. Pol δ is the key enzyme responsible for D-loop extension during homologous recombination.

We examined the effect of the ACA on breast cancer screening and diagnosis at a Los Angeles safety net hospital. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of breast cancer patients treated at our institution. We compared two cohorts: patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the years 2011–2012 (pre-ACA) vs. 2015–2016 (post-ACA). Results: There were no differences in number of screening mammograms performed, age at diagnosis, mammography-detected cancers, or clinical stage at diagnosis. There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who reported as self-pay (34% vs. 6%, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In the 2-year period following ACA implementation, there was limited impact on breast cancer presentation at a safety-net hospital.

Methods: Sedentary behavior variables were measured using thigh-worn activPALs, and included total daily sitting time, time in long sitting bouts, sit-to-stand transitions, and standing time. Cognitive function was assessed using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Domain. Separate multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between sedentary behavior variables with the cognitive domain scores of attention, executive functioning, episodic memory, working memory, and information processing speed. Results: Thirty breast cancer survivors with a mean age of 62.2 (SD = 7.8) years who were 2.6 (SD = 1.1) years since diagnosis completed study assessments. In multivariable linear regression models, more time spent standing was associated with faster information processing (b: 5.78; p = 0.03), and more time spent in long sitting bouts was associated with worse executive function (b: −2.82; p = 0.02), after adjustment for covariates. No other sedentary behavior variables were statistically significantly associated with the cognitive domains examined in this study. Conclusions: Two important sedentary constructs that are amenable to intervention, including time in prolonged sitting bouts and standing time, may be associated with cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. More research is needed to determine whether modifying these dimensions of sedentary behavior will improve cognitive function in women with a history of breast cancer, or prevent it from declining in breast cancer patients. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053598542

MP reduced proliferation in the cancer cells by up to 90% (10 mg GAE/L) but did not cause cytotoxicity in the non-cancer cells within the same concentration range. In contrast, in TNF-α-treated non-cancer MCF-12A cells, MP significantly decreased expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB while modulating mRNA and protein levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and up-regulated miR-126.

We sought to understand women's integrative naturopathic oncology (INO) use in addition to usual conventional oncology (UCO) use, their involvement in treatment decision-making (TDM), and their satisfaction with healthcare providers. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using baseline data from the Breast Cancer Integrative Oncology Study that recruited 427 women from INO clinics (INO cohort) and comparison women from the Cancer Surveillance System Registry who received UCO care (UCO cohort) in Western Washington State. Self-reported data and Registry data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and X2 tests to compare Receivers and Decliners in demographic and disease characteristics, use of INO in addition to UCO care, involvement in TDM, and satisfaction with healthcare providers. Results: Significantly more Decliners were in INO cohort than UCO cohort. Decliners in INO cohort were less likely to receive radiotherapy. Women who used INO care, and Decliners, compared with Receivers, tended to be “very involved” in their TDM. No difference was found in participation congruence, correspondence between preferred and actual involvement in medical TDM, between groups. Decliners in INO cohort reported significantly less satisfaction with their conventional oncologist than Receivers in INO cohort. Conclusions: Decliners of conventional adjuvant therapies were very involved in their TDM and those Decliners who seek INO care were less satisfied with their conventional oncologist; these women may need the most attention to assure they receive the care they need. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85060207680

Feasibility was measured by recruitment, group session attendance, and adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups. Changes in self-report and objectively measured cognitive function were compared between the three groups from baseline (T1) to completion of the intervention (T2) and 4 weeks post intervention (T3). Results: Fifty participants consented (83% of desired sample) with an overall attrition rate of 28%. Attrition was highest for the gentle exercise group (50%).

However, the mechanisms responsible for its antitumor activity are poorly studied. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms of nor-wogonin actions in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Methods: Effects of nor-wogonin on cell proliferation and viability of four TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HCC70, and HCC1806) and two non-tumorigenic breast cell lines (MCF-10A and AG11132) were assessed by BrdU incorporation assays and trypan blue dye exclusion tests. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were carried out by flow cytometry. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. Results: Nor-wogonin significantly inhibited the growth and decreased the viability of TNBC cells; however, it exhibited no or minimal effects in non-tumorigenic breast cells. Nor-wogonin (40 μM) was a more potent anti-proliferative and cytotoxic agent than wogonin (100 μM) and wogonoside (100 μM), which are structurally related to nor-wogonin. The antitumor effects of nor-wogonin can be attributed to cell cycle arrest via reduction of the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and CDK1. Furthermore, nor-wogonin induced mitochondrial apoptosis, (as evidenced by the increase in % of cells that are apoptotic), decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), increases in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, nor-wogonin attenuated the expression of the nuclear factor kappa-B and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways, which can be correlated with suppression of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 in TNBC cells. Conclusion: These results showed that nor-wogonin might be a potential multi-target agent for TNBC treatment. © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences","Final",,2-s2.0-85062083257

The tradeoff is that a greater volume of lung is exposed to low doses of RT, raising concern about the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP). Methods and Materials: Between July 2010 and January 2013, patients with node-positive breast cancer received inverse-planned, multibeam IMRT to the breast or chest wall and regional nodes, including the internal mammary nodes (IMNs). The primary endpoint was feasibility, predefined by dosimetric treatment planning criteria. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of RP grade 3 or greater and changes in pulmonary function measured with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 scales, pulmonary function tests and community-acquired pneumonia questionnaires, obtained at baseline and 6 months after IMRT. Clinical follow-up was every 6 months for up to 5 years. Results: Median follow-up was 53.4 months (range, 0-82 months). Of 113 patients enrolled, 104 completed follow-up procedures. Coverage of the breast or chest wall and IMN was comprehensive (median 48.1 Gy and 48.9 Gy, respectively). The median volume of lung receiving a high dose (V20Gy) and a low dose (V5) was 29% and 100%, respectively. The overall rate of respiratory toxicities was 10.6% (11/104), including 1 grade 3 RP event (0.96%). No differences were found in pulmonary function test or community-acquired pneumonia scores after IMRT. The 5-year rates of locoregional recurrence-free, disease-free, and overall survival were 93.2%, 63.6%, and 80.3%, respectively. Conclusions: Multibeam IMRT in patients with breast cancer receiving regional nodal irradiation was dosimetrically feasible, based on early treatment planning criteria. Despite the large volume of lung receiving low-dose RT, the incidence of grade 3 RP was remarkably low, justifying inverse-planned IMRT as a treatment modality for patients with high-risk breast cancer in whom conventional RT techniques prove inadequate. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060277981

Recently, US Food and Drug Administration approved anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy for solid tumors with deficient mismatch repair (MMR). In this study, we aimed to examine the prevalence of deficient MMR and its association with checkpoint immune markers in BCs. Immunohistochemistries (IHCs) with anti–MMR proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) and multiplex IHCs with anti–PD-L1, anti-CD8 or anti-CD163 were performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) with 101 triple-negative BCs (TNBC) and 197 HER2-positive BCs. Additional IHCs for MMR proteins were also performed on whole-tissue sections from selected cases. Thirteen cases (4.4%) showed complete loss of MMR protein on TMAs, including 7 TNBCs (6.9%) and 6 HER2-positive BCs. On whole-tissue sections, only one of 13 cases showed complete loss of MMR proteins, while the other 12 cases showed partial loss. PD-L1 expression was identified in 37% of cases and was significantly higher in TNBCs than in HER2-positive BCs (71% versus 19%). Furthermore, BCs with complete/partial loss of MMR demonstrated significantly more PD-L1 and CD8 expressions than BCs with preserved MMR proteins. Although complete loss of MMR proteins exists in an extremely low frequency, partial loss is not uncommon in BCs. The association of partial loss of MMR proteins with increased PD-L1 and CD8 expression suggests a potential use of MMR testing as a screening method for anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy in BCs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062702507

Results: Most women were white (93.7%) and married (71.5%); mean age was 60.1 (21–90) years. Poor sleep was self-reported by 53% of women. Seven variables were highly associated with sleep quality (p ≤ 0.001). The first model found younger age, lower physical activity, and higher fatigue were the strongest combined and independent variables predicting poor sleep quality (F = 23.0 (p &lt;.001), R 2 = 0.103). Participants self-reported lower health status on most SF36v2 subscales [Z = 44.9 (11.6) to 49.1 (10.1)]. A second model found that all subscales were predictors of poor sleep; vitality, mental health, bodily pain, and general health were the strongest predictors (F = 101.3 (p &lt;.001), R 2 = 0.26). Conclusions: Results confirm previously identified risk factors and reveal inconsistencies in other variables. Clinicians need to routinely screen for the identified risk factors of self-reported poor sleep quality. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85051861512

Depression may also occur post treatment and may partially mediate the effects of cancer treatment on cognition. Additionally, physical activity has been shown to mitigate treatment effects on cognition and depression. This study examined the role of depression in mediating the effects of cancer treatment on cognitive function (perceived cognitive impairment, PCI; perceived cognitive ability, PCA) in breast cancer survivors and explored the role of physical activity in moderating these effects. Materials and methods: 317 breast cancer survivors were recruited via Army of Women. Participants were 40–75 years old and had stage 0 (in situ) to IIIc breast cancer and were less than 10 years post treatment. Participants completed a demographic and treatment questionnaire, as well as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Depressive symptoms significantly contributed to cognitive function in all models. Moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity moderated breast cancer treatment effects on depression and cognition. Chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and anastrozole all demonstrated negative effects on cognition. Conclusion: The results from this study support the importance of examining mediating factors in the effects of cancer treatment on cognition, particularly depression, following cancer treatment. Effects of treatment on cognition in breast cancer survivors are partially explained by changes in depressive symptoms, although chemotherapy may impact cognition independent of depression. Importantly, physical activity may reduce the risk of depression and cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85060928219

Compounds 15a and 18 revealed significant cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and MDA231, therefore their inhibitory potencies against p38α MAP kinase were evaluated. Remarkably they exhibited significant IC 50 of 0.04 µM comparable to SB203580 (IC 50 ; 0.50 µM) as a reference standard. These promising results of cytotoxic activity and significant inhibition of p38α MAP kinase, were confirmed by exploring the effect of benzofuran derivative (18) on the apoptotic induction and cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cell line. Compound 18 induced preG1 apoptosis and cell growth arrest at G2/M phase preventing the mitotic cycle. Moreover it activated the caspase-7 which executes apoptosis. Molecular docking study was carried out using GOLD program to predict the mode of binding interaction of the synthesized compounds into the target p38α MAPK.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning scheme with a novel loss function for weakly supervised breast cancer diagnosis. According to the Nottingham Grading System, mitotic count plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis and grading. To determine the cancer grade, pathologists usually need to manually count mitosis from a great deal of histopathology images, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This paper proposes an automatic method for detecting mitosis. We regard the mitosis detection task as a semantic segmentation problem and use a deep fully convolutional network to address it. Different from conventional training data used in semantic segmentation system, the training label of mitosis data is usually in the format of centroid pixel, rather than all the pixels belonging to a mitosis. The centroid label is a kind of weak label, which is much easier to annotate and can save the effort of pathologists a lot. However, technically this weak label is not sufficient for training a mitosis segmentation model. To tackle this problem, we expand the single-pixel label to a novel label with concentric circles, where the inside circle is a mitotic region and the ring around the inside circle is a “middle ground”. During the training stage, we do not compute the loss of the ring region because it may have the presence of both mitotic and non-mitotic pixels. This new loss termed as “concentric loss” is able to make the semantic segmentation network be trained with the weakly annotated mitosis data. On the generated segmentation map from the segmentation model, we filter out low confidence and obtain mitotic cells. On the challenging ICPR 2014 MITOSIS dataset and AMIDA13 dataset, we achieve a 0.562 F-score and 0.673 F-score respectively, outperforming all previous approaches significantly. On the latest TUPAC16 dataset, we obtain a F-score of 0.669, which is also the state-of-the-art result. The excellent results quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mitosis segmentation network with the concentric loss.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mutational profile of the PIK3CA, TP53, and CDKN2A genes, comparing the mammary tissue with the respective circulating free DNA (cfDNA). The PIK3CA, TP53, and CDKN2A genes were sequenced (PCR-Sanger) in 58 women with impalpable lesions (49 malignant and 9 benign) with the respective cfDNA. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate statistical significance between the clinical variables and mutational profile. A total of 51 out of 58 samples generated successful mutation profiles in both breast lesion and cfDNA.

However, the unwanted risks of radiation must be considered as well as the impact on future breast reconstruction options. The purpose of this study was to assess the preference of plastic surgeons when given the hypothetical diagnosis of breast cancer. METHODS: A survey assessing treatment preference of 3 hypothetical breast cancer diagnosis scenarios was designed and distributed by American Society of Plastic Surgeons via e-mail invite to its members. RESULTS: The risk of cancer recurrence was the most common reason for treatment preferences of all three choices. However, for ductal carcinoma in situ, unilateral mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction is the preferred option with the second most influential reason of avoiding the risks of radiation therapy. For invasive ductal carcinoma node negative, unilateral mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction was the preferred option also due to risks of radiation therapy and anxiety of future surveillance. For invasive ductal carcinoma node positive, bilateral mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction was the preferred choice because of anxiety of future surveillance and also risks of radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In general, plastic surgeons did not prefer breast conservation therapy for in situ and early-stage breast cancer. Although the most common rationale for total mastectomy was risk of cancer recurrence for all disease severity, risks of radiation therapy are real and play an integral role in the decision-making process. In understanding our own biases, we can help better empathize with patients in consultation for breast reconstruction.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062708759

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of the first consecutive 100 large-volume displacement oncoplastic surgeries at our institution between August 2015 and June 2018. Eighty-five patients had an immediate symmetry operation performed on the contralateral breast. Information on malignant lesions and high-risk lesions was obtained from the patient's pathology report. RESULTS: Seven different surgical techniques were used for both the cancerous and contralateral breasts. The WISE pattern skin incision pattern was most frequently used, along with the superomedial pedicle design. Fourteen cases (16.5%) had malignant and/or high-risk lesions incidentally detected. Specifically, there was a breast cancer prevalence of 4.8% in the contralateral symmetry breast specimen. CONCLUSION: Plastic surgeons should be aware that there is a substantial minority of contralateral specimens that have high-risk or malignant lesions, which underscores the importance of specimen orientation and communication with the associated pathologist.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062704631

Breast cancer is the most common cancer found in women and if it is identified at an early stage by the use of mammograms, x-ray images of the breast, then the chances of successful treatment can be high. Typically, mammograms are screened by radiologists who determine whether a biopsy is necessary to ascertain the presence of cancer. Although historical screening methods have been effective, recent advances in computer vision and web technologies may be able to improve the accuracy, speed, cost, and accessibility of mammogram screenings. We propose a total screening solution comprised of three main components: a web service for uploading images and reviewing results, a machine learning algorithm for accepting or rejecting images as valid mammograms, and an artificial neural network for locating potential malignancies. Once an image is uploaded to our web service, an image acceptor determines whether or not the image is a mammogram. The image acceptor is primarily a one-class SVM built on features derived with a variational autoencoder. If an image is accepted as a mammogram, the malignancy identifier, a ResNet-101 Faster R-CNN, will locate tumors within the mammogram. On test data, the image acceptor had only 2 misclassifications out of 410 mammograms and 2 misclassifications out of 1,640 non-mammograms while the malignancy identifier achieved 0.951 AUROC when tested on BI-RADS 1, 5, and 6 images from the INbreast dataset. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85061357398

A cohort of 18 patients with MBC yielded adequate DNA from microdissected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks. NGS was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq cancer hotspot mutation panel version 2 kit, which targets hotspot regions in 50 genes. Immunohistochemical stains for androgen receptor (AR), and programmed cell death ligand-1 were performed. A total of 23 genetic alterations were identified in 15 (83.3%) of 18 patients. Eleven genetic alterations in the PI3K signaling pathway were identified in 9 (50.0%) of 18 patients, including 7 PIK3CA mutations (38.9%), 3 PTEN genetic alterations (16.7%), and 1 AKT1 mutation (5.6%). Ten (55.6%) of 18 patients each harbored 1 TP53 genetic alteration. Additional genetic alterations identified were 1 HRAS mutation and 1 ATM mutation. AR immunoreactivity was identified in 2 (11.1%) of 18 patients. Programmed cell death ligand-1 was negative in all patients. NGS analysis demonstrated that PI3K pathway–related genetic alterations were detected in a high percentage of MBCs, suggesting that targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway may be promising in patients with MBC.

Methods: Hispanics/Latinos diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer within 15 months of treatment completion (n = 288) completed questionnaires as part of an NCI-funded project. Results: Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors reported greater unmet needs compared to previously published norms in primarily non-Hispanic/Latino white samples. Across the three cancer types, the two most common unmet needs were in the psychological domain: fear of metastasis (32.6%) and concern for close others (31.3%). However, unmet needs varied by cancer type. Factors associated with greater unmet needs included more recent cancer diagnosis (OR.98 [.96–.99]), younger age (OR.96–.97 [.93–.99]), female gender (OR 2.53–3.75 [1.53–7.36]), and being single (OR 1.82 [1.11–2.97]). Breast cancer survivors reported greater unmet needs than both prostate and colorectal cancer survivors (OR 2.33–5.86 [1.27–14.01]). Adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates, unmet needs were associated with lower patient-provider communication self-efficacy (B = −.18–−.22, p’s <.01) and satisfaction with cancer care (B = − 3.57–− 3.81, p’s <.05), and greater breast (B = − 4.18–− 8.30, p’s <.01) and prostate (B = − 6.01–− 8.13, p’s <.01) cancer-specific symptom burden.

Methods: Two focus groups (n = 6 participants) and three one-on-one interviews (n = 3) were conducted in either Spanish or English among adult, Mexican-American mothers with a current cancer diagnosis of any stage residing in US-Mexico border communities. Participants reported their perceived concerns, parenting challenges, and openness to discussing an incurable cancer diagnosis with a dependent child. Audio files were transcribed into English and qualitatively coded using content analysis. Results: Participants, most with breast cancer, ranged in age from 25 to 47. Five had considered the possibility of their own death from advanced cancer and three had previously discussed this with their children. While many expected their children would carry on well without them, seven expressed concern for the emotional/spiritual well-being of their children. Mothers anticipated physical and time-based parenting challenges but wanted the opportunity to focus on themselves and their children in advance of death. All but one would be willing to discuss an advance cancer diagnosis with dependent children; four expressed the value of doing so or the potential harm of abdicating this responsibility.

Multiple regions of interest were selected on each lymphatic channel and signal intensity was recorded for 3 minutes to generate contractility curves. Each lymphatic contraction was identified using a novel, systematic, and algorithmic approach. RESULTS: Twenty-nine consecutive patients with unilateral node-positive breast cancer were included for analysis. Average patient age was 54.5 (13) years and mean BMI was 26.8 kg/m (4). The mean lymphatic contractility of patients who received taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.7 contractions/minute (c/m) (n = 19) compared to 1.1 c/m in those who received no neoadjuvant therapy (n = 10), (P = 0.11). In subgroup analysis, patients who reported taxane induced neuropathy demonstrated significantly lower lymphatic contractility values than those who were asymptomatic or did not receive any chemotherapy (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used a novel method for quantifying and evaluating lymphatic contractility rates in routine ICG lymphangiograms. Diminished lymphatic contractility was noted in patients who received taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not. Taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy may adversely affect the lymphatic system in the breast cancer population. A larger patient cohort with longer follow-up time is needed to validate this finding and evaluate any potential association with breast cancer-related lymphedema development.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062725978

One of the ways in which tumors promote M2 polarization and evade macrophage-mediated destruction is through upregulation of CD47 expression. As a myeloid-specific immune checkpoint, CD47 interacts with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages and monocytes to prevent phagocytosis. Herein, the effect of RRx-001 on CD47 and SIRPα expression was evaluated as well as its activity in vivo in macrophage-depleted tumors. In vitro, RRx-001 was found to decrease the expression levels of CD47 and SIRPα on tumor cells and monocytes/macrophages, respectively, reducing the phagocytosis inhibitory function of the CD47/SIRPα interaction. In vivo, macrophage depletion by clodronate in an A549 xenograft-bearing mouse model attenuated the ability of RRx-001 to suppress tumor growth, which suggests that the presence of infiltrated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is a sine qua non condition for the antitumor activity of RRx-001. Furthermore, these in vitro effects translate into significant antitumor activity in mouse models of lung cancer. Importantly, unlike anti-CD47 antibodies, RRx-001, which has been evaluated in close to 300 patients in 9 clinical trials, is not associated with any hematologic toxicities. On the basis of demonstrated antitumor activity and minimal toxicity in phase II clinical trials, RRx-001 has received clearance from the FDA and the EMA for phase III, multicenter studies in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. © 2018","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061043928

The purpose of this study was to evaluate variation in reconstructive modality at the health service area (HSA) level and its relationship to the plastic surgeon workforce in the same area. METHODS: Using the Arkansas, California, Florida, Nebraska, and New York state inpatient databases, we conducted a cross-sectional study of adult women undergoing mastectomy for cancer from 2009 to 2012. The primary outcomes were receipt of reconstruction and the reconstructive modality (autologous tissue versus implant) used. All data were aggregated to the HSA level and augmented with plastic surgeon workforce data. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between the outcomes and workforce. RESULTS: The final sample included 67,984 women treated across 103 HSAs. The average patient was 58.5 years, had private insurance (53.5%), and underwent unilateral mastectomy for invasive cancer. At the HSA level, the median immediate breast reconstruction rate was 25.0% and varied widely (interquartile range, 43.2%). In areas where reconstruction was performed, the median autologous (10.2%) and free tissue (0.4%) reconstruction rates were low, with more than 30% of HSAs never using autologous tissue. There was a direct correlation between an HSA's plastic surgeon density and autologous reconstruction rate (r = 0.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite efforts to remove financial barriers and improve patients' awareness, accessibility to various modalities of reconstruction is inadequate for many women. Efforts are needed to improve the availability of more comprehensive breast reconstruction care.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062691498

Studies demonstrate that Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach (LYMPHA) may greatly reduce the incidence of lymphedema in high-risk groups. The objective of this study is to summarize the evidence relating lymphedema incidence to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), regional lymph node radiation (RLNR) therapy, and LYMPHA. METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify studies involving breast cancer patients undergoing ALND with or without RLNR. Our primary outcome was the development of lymphedema. We analyzed the effect of LYMPHA on lymphedema incidence. We chose the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analytic model owing to the clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity of studies. RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 1476 articles. After screening, 19 studies were included. Data were extracted from 3035 patients, 711 of whom had lymphedema. The lymphedema rate was significantly higher when RLNR was administered with ALND compared with ALND alone (P < 0.001). The pooled cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 14.1% in patients undergoing ALND versus 2.1% in those undergoing LYMPHA and ALND (P = 0.029). The pooled cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 33.4% in those undergoing ALND and RLNR versus 10.3% in those undergoing ALND, RLNR, and LYMPHA (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Axillary lymph node dissection and RLNR are important interventions to obtain regional control for many patients but were found to constitute an increased risk of development of lymphedema. Our findings support that LYMPHA, a preventive surgical technique, may reduce the risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema in high-risk patients.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062688792

We sought to determine patient preferences regarding the use of newer technology in delivering test results during cancer surveillance. Methods: A single institutional, cross-sectional analysis of the preferences of adult cancer survivors regarding the means (secure digital communication versus phone call or office visit) to receive surveillance test results was undertaken. Results: Among 257 respondents, the average age was 59.1 years (SD 13.5) and 61.8% were female. Common malignancies included melanoma/sarcoma (29.5%), thyroid (25.7%), breast (22.8%), and gastrointestinal (22.0%) cancer. Although patients expressed a relative preference to receive normal surveillance results via MyChart or secure e-mail, the majority preferred abnormal imaging (87.2%) or blood results (85.9%) to be communicated by in-office appointments or phone calls irrespective of age or cancer type. Patients with a college degree or higher were more likely to prefer electronic means of communication of abnormal blood results compared with a telephone call or in-person visit (odds ratio 2.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.01–4.73, P <.05). In contrast, patients >65 years were more likely to express a preference for telephone or in-person communication of normal imaging results (odds ratio: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.16–3.56, P <.05) versus patients ≤65 years. Preference also varied according to malignancy type. Conclusion: Although many cancer patients preferred to receive “normal” surveillance results electronically, the majority preferred receiving abnormal results via direct conversation with their provider. Shifting routine communication of normal surveillance results to technology-based applications may improve patient satisfaction and decrease health care system costs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061307903

The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status. The U.S. Surgeon General should reevaluate the evidence for the additional causes and consider reclassifying them as causally attributable to smoking. © 2019 The Author","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060518929

Methods: We systematically searched for original research in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE and HuGE Navigator from database inception until January 2018. Studies on association between polymorphism and antineoplastic-induced cardiovascular toxicity in patients treated for cancer of all antineoplastic agents were included except for anthracycline. Case reports, conference abstracts, reviews and non-patient studies were excluded. Data extracted by two independent reviewers were combined with random-effects model and reported according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Results: The 35 studies included examined a total of 219 SNPs in 80 genes, 11 antineoplastic and 5 types of cardiovascular toxicities.

Among the subset of participants who were in a committed relationship, we examined the congruence in reciprocal processes between patient-spouse/caregiver and patient-physician dyads. Methods: An online retrospective survey of cancer patients was conducted in the USA. The reciprocal process of decisional conflict within the patient-physician dyad was measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The Perception of Spousal Reciprocity Scale (POSRS) was used to measure reciprocity in the patient-spouse/caregiver dyad. Results: The final analytic cohort consisted of 116 participants. The average age of participants was 58.4 years, the majority were female (66.7%), and the most common diagnosis was breast cancer (27.9%). Participants who perceived their physician as more helpful were more likely to report lower levels of decisional conflict on the DCS total scale and subscales (r range = 0.24–0.46, p < 0.05). Higher scores on the PSORS were associated with lower levels of decisional conflict (r = − 0.37, p < 0.01).

We evaluated the effect of Novartis Access in Kenya, the first country to receive the programme. Methods: We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in eight counties in Kenya. Counties (clusters) were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group with a covariate-constrained randomisation procedure that maximised balance on a set of demographic and health variables. In intervention counties, public and non-profit health facilities were allowed to purchase Novartis Access medicines from the Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS). Data were collected from all facilities served by MEDS and a sample of households in study counties. Households were eligible if they had at least one adult patient who had been diagnosed and prescribed medicines for one of the non-communicable diseases targeted by the programme: hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, asthma, or breast cancer. Primary outcomes were availability and price of portfolio medicines at health facilities, irrespective of brand; and availability of medicines at patient households. Impacts were estimated with intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02773095). Findings: On March 8, 2016, we randomly assigned eight clusters to intervention (four clusters; 74 health facilities; 342 patients) or control (four clusters; 63 health facilities; 297 patients). 69 intervention and 58 control health facilities, and 306 intervention and 265 control patients were evaluated after a 15 month intervention period (last visit February 28, 2018). Novartis Access significantly increased the availability of amlodipine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·84, 95% CI 1·10 to 7·37; p=0·031) and metformin (aOR 4·78, 95% CI 1·44 to 15·86; p=0·011) at health facilities, but did not affect the availability of portfolio medicines overall (adjusted β [aβ] 0·05, 95% CI −0·01 to 0·10; p=0·096) or their price (aβ 0·48, 95% CI −1·12 to 0·72; p=0·500). The programme did not affect medicine availability at patient households (aOR 0·83, 95% CI 0·44 to 1·57; p=0·569). Interpretation: Novartis Access had little effect in its first year in Kenya. Access programmes operate within complex health systems and reducing the wholesale price of medicines might not always or immediately translate to improved patient access. The evidence generated by this study will inform Novartis's efforts to improve their programme going forward. The study also contributes to the public evidence base on strategies for improving access to medicines globally.

Therefore, discovering modulators that are capable of inhibiting the drug efflux function or expression of ABCB1 and re-sensitizing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to anticancer agents is of great clinical importance. Regrettably, due to potential adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions and toxicity in patients, researchers have struggled to develop a synthetic inhibitor of ABCB1 that is clinically applicable to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Alternatively, through drug repositioning of approved drugs, we discovered that the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) inhibitor midostaurin blocks the drug transport function of ABCB1 and re-sensitizes ABCB1-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Our findings were further supported by results demonstrating that midostaurin potentiates drug-induced apoptosis in ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells and inhibits the ATPase activity of ABCB1. Considering that midostaurin is a clinically approved anticancer agent, our findings revealed an additional action of midostaurin and that patients with multidrug-resistant tumors may benefit from a combination therapy of midostaurin with standard chemotherapy, which should be further investigated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060199304

Although expression of CEA largely ceases prior to birth, several human epithelial cancers, including colorectal, gastric, squamous esophageal, and breast carcinomas have been known to overexpress CEA, suggesting its potential as an immunotherapeutic target. Using a transgenic mouse model constitutively expressing human CEA in a spatiotemporal manner as a self-protein and a syngeneic mouse colon cancer cell line, MC38-CEA, overexpressing CEA, we tested the potential of a novel genetic immunotherapy approach against CEA-expressing tumors, using recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding CEA (rAAV-CEA) and appropriately timed immune adjuvant application. Results of the study demonstrated breaking of immune tolerance for CEA with this vaccine regimen and an anti-tumor response, resulting in tumor-free survival. Furthermore, tumor challenge of CEA-vaccinated mice with parental MC38 cells not expressing CEA did not result in protection from tumor development, confirming that the protection against tumor development is CEA specific. The study illustrates the feasibility of utilizing rAAV vectors in combination with an immunostimulatory adjuvant to break tolerance to weakly immunogenic self-antigens and for an anti-tumor response. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059679860

However, PTX-PM is unstable in blood, has rapid clearance, and causes dose-limiting toxicity. We have synthesized a prodrug for PTX (7-OH), using oligo(lactic acid) as a novel pro-moiety (o(LA) 8 -PTX) specifically for PEG-b-PLA micelles, gaining higher loading and slower release of o(LA) 8 -PTX over PTX. Notably, o(LA) 8 -PTX prodrug converts into PTX by a backbiting reaction in vitro, without requiring esterases. We hypothesize that o(LA) 8 -PTX-loaded PEG-b-PLA micelles (o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM) has a lower C max and higher plasma AUC than PTX-PM for improved therapeutic effectiveness. In Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 mg/kg, compared to o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (10% w/w loading) and PTX-PM (10%), o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (50% w/w loading) produces a 2- and 3-fold higher plasma AUC 0–24 of PTX, lactic acid-PTX, and o(LA) 2 -PTX (o(LA) 0-2 -PTX), respectively. For o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM at 10 and 50% w/w loading, PTX and lactic acid-PTX are major bioactive metabolites, respectively. Fast prodrug conversion of o(LA) 8 -PTX in vivo versus in vitro (by backbiting) suggests that o(LA) 8 is a good substrate for esterases. At 60 mg/kg (qwx3), o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (50%) has higher antitumor activity than o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (10%) and PTX-PM (10%) in a syngeneic 4T1-luc breast tumor model based on measurements of tumor volume, 4T1-luc breast tumor bioluminescence, and survival. Importantly, intravenous administration of o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM is well tolerated by BALB/c mice. In summary, oligo(lactic acid) 8 -PTX is more compatible than PTX with PEG-b-PLA micelles, more stable, and may expand the role of PEG-b-PLA micelles from “solubilizer” into “nanocarrier” for PTX as a next-generation taxane for cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061787045

Compared to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), treatment with gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) offers a better chance at neurocognitive preservation. The goal of our retrospective study is to report the overall survival (OS) in patients receiving GKRS and to identify factors that improve survival outcomes. Methods: The records of 80 patients with primary BC treated with GKRS at the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center between 2000 and 2013 were reviewed. OS was calculated from the date of first GKRS treatment. Other factors studied were age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), tumor subtype, having WBRT and/or surgical resection pre- or post-GKRS, and number of brain metastases treated with GKRS. Results: Median age was 56.2 years. OS from first GKRS was 13.1 months (95% CI 7.6–21.9). On univariate analysis, improved survival was associated with HER-2 subtype (p = 0.026), KPS score > 80 (p = 0.009), and good control of systemic disease at time of GKRS (p = 0.020). Multivariable analysis detected a significantly longer survival with HER-2 positivity (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06–0.76, p = 0.017) and a strong trend in patients with craniotomy prior to GKRS (HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01–1.11, p = 0.06). Conclusions: GKRS is a promising therapy for treating brain metastasis from BC, particularly in those with HER-2 positivity and high-performance scores even in those patients with > 5 brain metastases. Furthermore, GKRS may also be a useful adjunct to surgical resection in such patients. High rates of neurological death remain from BC brain metastases; however, and need further investigation. © 2018, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053384930

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 BCS who returned to work following diagnosis and/or primary cancer treatment. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to investigate responses. Results Three recurring themes emerged: (1) challenges at work related to residual effects of diagnosis and/or primary treatment; (2) positive and negative responses from employers and/or supervisors; and (3) positive and negative responses from co-workers/colleagues. Although several participants experienced a high level of workplace support, there was a subgroup that did report challenges related to symptom burden, cognitive limitations, and both positive and negative responses by employers and co-workers were reported. Conclusions Findings indicate similar challenges in BCS who RTW during and/or following cancer treatment in both rapidly developing and developed nations. Results suggest that regardless of the existence of workplace policies and practices related to RTW for workers with a history of cancer, a subgroup of BCS experience similar challenges when returning to work.

Both experimental and epidemiological studies suggest the role of COMT in pathogenesis of human breast cancer (BCa). It was previously reported that inhibition of COMT enzyme activity in estradiol-treated human breast epithelial carcinoma-derived MCF-7 cells caused increased oxidative DNA damage and formation of mutagenic depurinating adducts. To improve our understanding of factors influencing estrogen metabolism in BCa, it requires a mechanistic study illustrating the regulation of this ‘gate-keeper’. We investigated the epigenetic mechanisms underlying decreased COMT transcription in MCF-7 cells exposed to 17ß-estradiol (E2) and the phytoestrogen, genistein (GEN). CpG site-specific methylation at promoters for both soluble (S) and membrane-bound (MB) COMT transcripts were assessed. Both E2 and GEN induced CpG site-specific methylation within the distal promoter of MB-COMT. In addition, ChIP analysis showed that there was increased binding of DNMT3B, MBD2 and HDAC1 within this promoter. These epigenetic changes were associated with decreased COMT transcript levels. Interestingly, sulforaphane, an antioxidant commonly found in cruciferous vegetables, was able to reverse the estrogen-induced epigenetic changes and gene silencing of COMT. Our data provide a new insight in epigenetically targeting COMT transcription. Since reactive estrogen metabolites may contribute to breast cancer, our findings may help in developing prevention and/or intervention strategies for human BCa. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060918953

Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed 11,657 PROMIS surveys from patients with breast cancer and 4411 surveys from patients with prostate cancer, and it calculated survey completion rates and global physical health (GPH) and global mental health (GMH) scores between 2013 and 2018. Results: A total of 36.6% of eligible patients with breast cancer and 23.7% of patients with prostate cancer completed at least 1 survey, with completion rates lower among black patients for both tumor types (P <.05). The mean T scores (calibrated to a general population mean of 50) for GPH were 48.4 ± 9 for breast cancer and 50.6 ± 9 for prostate cancer, and the GMH scores were 52.7 ± 8 and 52.1 ± 9, respectively. GPH and GMH were frequently lower among ethnic minorities, patients without private health insurance, and those with advanced disease. Conclusions: This analysis provides important baseline data on patient-reported global health in breast and prostate cancer.

Microglia priming results in chronic neuroinflammation and can contribute to neuronal degeneration and dysfunction, thereby offering a potential mechanism for altered brain function that persists after tumor removal. This study examined whether mammary tumors alter microglia and augment the inflammatory profile and behavior of mice. To test this, non-metastatic mammary tumor cells (67NR) were injected orthotopically into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice, allowed to grow for 16 days, and then the tumors were removed via mastectomy. Following a 14-day surgical recovery, the mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then central and peripheral inflammation, anxiety, and depressive-like behavior were evaluated. Here we show that major central and peripheral inflammatory markers were not altered by tumor growth nor mastectomy surgery alone. However, hippocampal mRNA expression of major proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα was increased in tumor removal animals, persisting past surgical recovery.

In sum, these data demonstrate that the combination of tumor and mastectomy promotes neuroinflammation; however, immune challenge did not elucidate this inflammation as maladaptive for the host. © 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85057318815

MSY is 1.5 times more common in Hispanic women compared with non-Hispanic women. Although exercise mitigates MSY in BCS, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, few studies to date have focused on minorities. This secondary analysis examined ethnicity as a moderator of the effects of a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on MSY, sarcopenic obesity, and serum biomarkers in BCS. Methods: A total of 100 eligible BCS were randomized to exercise (50 BCS) or usual care (50 BCS). The exercise intervention promoted moderate to vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise 3 times a week for 16 weeks. MSY z scores, sarcopenic obesity, and serum biomarkers were measured at baseline, after the intervention, and at the 28-week follow-up (exercise group only). Linear mixed models adjusted for baseline values of the outcome, age, disease stage, adjuvant treatment, and recent physical activity were used to evaluate effect modification by ethnicity. Results: The study sample was 57% Hispanic BCS (HBCS) and 43% non-Hispanic BCS (NHBCS). HBCS were younger, of greater adiposity, and had been diagnosed with more advanced cancers compared with NHBCS (P<.001). Ethnicity was found to moderate the mean differences in exercise training on triglycerides (-36.4 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],-64.1 to -18.8 mg/dL), glucose (-8.6 mg/dL; 95% CI, -19.1 to -3.0 mg/dL), and C-reactive protein (-3.3 mg/L; 95% CI, -7.3 to -0.9 mg/L). Conclusions: HBCS appear to have poorer metabolic profiles and therefore may derive relatively larger metabolic changes from exercise compared with NHBCS. Clinical exercise interventions may attenuate existing health disparities across diverse groups of BCS. © 2018 American Cancer Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85057871032

Methods and Materials: In a prospective longitudinal study of 87 patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, or mediastinal lymphoma treated with photon or proton thoracic RT, blood samples were obtained pre-RT and after completion of RT (median, 20 days; interquartile range [IQR], 1-35). High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, placental growth factor (PIGF), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) were measured. Associations between MHD, V5 and V30, and biomarker levels and associations between echocardiography-derived measures of cardiac function and biomarker levels were assessed in multivariable linear regression models. Analyses were performed according to the following subgroups: (1) breast cancer alone and (2) lung cancer and lymphoma combined. Results: The median (IQR) estimates of MHD ranged from 1.3 Gy (0.9-2.4) in breast cancer (n = 60) to 6.8 Gy (5.4-10.2) in mediastinal lymphoma (n = 14) and 8.4 Gy (6.7-16.1) in lung cancer (n = 13) patients (P <.001). There were no significant increases in biomarker levels from pre-RT to post-RT in breast cancer. In lung cancer/lymphoma, PIGF increased from a median (IQR) of 20 ng/L (16-26) to 22 ng/L (16-30) (P =.005), and GDF-15 increased from 1171 ng/L (755-2493) to 1887 ng/L (903-3763) (P =.006). MHD, V5, and V30 were significantly associated with post-RT PIGF and GDF-15 levels in multivariable models. Changes in biomarkers were not significantly associated with changes in echocardiography-derived measures of cardiac function. Conclusion: Contemporary thoracic RT induces acute abnormalities in vascular and inflammatory biomarkers that are associated with radiation dose-volume metrics, particularly in lung cancer and mediastinal lymphoma. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the impact of these changes on the development of overt cardiac disease. © 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85059527627

We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of palbociclib in Japanese women in PALOMA-2. Methods: In this phase 3 study, 666 postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2– ABC were randomized 2:1 to palbociclib (125 mg/day [3 weeks on/1 week off]) plus letrozole (2.5 mg daily) or placebo plus letrozole. A prespecified, exploratory, subgroup analysis of Japanese patients (n = 46) was conducted to compare results with those of the overall population.

Palbociclib dose reductions due to toxicity (mainly neutropenia) were more common in Japanese patients (62.5% vs 36.0%); few permanently discontinued due to AEs. Although mean palbociclib trough concentration was higher in Japanese patients vs non-Asians (95.4 vs 61.7 ng/mL), the range of individual values of the Japanese patients was within that of non-Asians.

However, data abstraction rules from 2004 to 2007 resulted in missing clinical stage for a high percentage of cases. We investigated how this missingness can bias results in breast cancer studies including patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: The impact of missing clinical stage on the estimated percentage of breast cancers treated with NAC versus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) was examined from 2004 to 2013. Trends in NAC use were presented, excluding those cases with missing clinical stage, and compared with trends after multiple imputation, performed using the chained equations approach with predictive mean matching. Results: Clinical stage was missing for 56% of cases in 2004–2007, versus 12% in 2008–2013, and was missing more than twice as often for AC patients versus NAC patients (31% vs. 12% overall), with the largest difference occurring in 2004–2007 (60% vs. 27% missing). Because stage was more frequently missing in AC patients, excluding those missing clinical stage introduced bias when considering NAC versus AC trends. With multiple imputation, significant increases in NAC use were identified between 2004 and 2013 for each stage: use for stage I was 2% in 2004 and 5% in 2013, use for stage II was 11% in 2004 and 24% in 2013, use for stage III was 34% in 2004 and 46% in 2013, in contrast to an analysis excluding those missing stage, which suggested little or no increase within any stage. Conclusion: NCDB data abstraction rules from 2004 to 2007 resulted in missing clinical stage for > 50% of breast cancers, which may introduce substantial bias. Multiple imputation or exclusion of the years 2004–2007 should be considered to mitigate the problem of missing clinical stage in NCDB. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059579044

Methods: The authors assessed cases in the US general population (N=7,147,476) for 16 different cancer types as ascertained from 11 cancer registries. The presence of a solid organ transplant prior to diagnosis (N=11,416 cancer cases) was identified through linkage with the national transplantation registry (1987-2014). Cox models were used to examine the association between transplantation status and cancer-specific mortality, adjusting for demographic characteristics and cancer stage. Results: For the majority of cancers, cancer-specific mortality was higher in transplant recipients compared with other patients with cancer. The increase was particularly pronounced for melanoma (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.18-3.00) and cancers of the breast (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.61-2.19), bladder (aHR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.58-2.17), and colorectum (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.60-1.96), but it also was increased for cancers of the oral cavity/pharynx, stomach, pancreas, kidney, and lung as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aHR range, 1.21-1.47). Associations remained significant after adjustment for first-course cancer treatment and generally were stronger among patients with local-stage cancers for whom potentially curative treatment was provided, including patients with melanoma (aHR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.94-4.97) and cancers of the colorectum (aHR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.07-3.70), breast (aHR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.50-2.88), and prostate (aHR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.12-2.29), despite the lack of an association for prostate cancer overall.

Methods: We administrated a cross-sectional study in three counties in Shandong province from August to September 2017. The five-level EuroQol-5-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire was used to measure the HRQoL among cancer patients at least 8 months post-diagnosis. The Chinese population-based preference trade-off time (TTO) model and discrete choice experiment (DCE) were used to convert the EQ-5D-5L utility score. Tobit regression model was used to identify independent associations between socio-demographic, clinical variables with the HRQoL. Results: In total, 452 cancer survivors were included.

This study examines the suicide risk within the year after a cancer diagnosis. This is the largest study to assess recent trends in suicide risk after a cancer diagnosis. Methods: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. All patients diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2014 were selected. The event was defined as death due to suicide within the first year after a cancer diagnosis, and patients who experienced the event after their diagnosis were observed. The observed/expected (O/E) ratio was assessed as well as the excess risk per 10,000 person-years to determine the suicide risk change after the diagnosis in comparison with the general population. Results: A total of 4,671,989 patients with cancer were included; 1585 committed suicide within 1 year of their diagnosis. The risk of suicide increased significantly with an O/E ratio of 2.52 and with an excess risk of 2.51 per 10,000 person-years. When the risk of suicide was studied according to the cancer site, the highest increases in the O/E ratio came after diagnoses of pancreatic cancer (8.01) and lung cancer (6.05). The risk of suicide also increased significantly after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer with an O/E ratio of 2.08. However, the risk of suicidal death did not increase significantly after breast and prostate cancer diagnoses. Conclusions: The risk of suicide increases significantly in the first year after a diagnosis of cancer in comparison with the general population, and this increase varies with the type and prognosis of cancer. Close observation and referral to mental health services, when indicated, are important for mitigating such risk. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85059572745

Because cardiac substructures are poorly visualized on treatment-planning computed tomography (CT) scans, we used the superior soft-tissue contrast of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to optimize a hybrid MR/CT atlas for substructure dose assessment using CT. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients with left-sided breast cancer underwent a T2-weighted MR imaging scan and noncontrast simulation CT scans. A radiation oncologist delineated 13 substructures (chambers, great vessels, coronary arteries, etc) using MR/CT information via cardiac-confined rigid registration. Ground-truth contours for 20 patients were inputted into an intensity-based deformable registration atlas and applied to 11 validation patients. Automatic segmentations involved using majority vote and Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) strategies with 1 to 15 atlas matches. Performance was evaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement, and centroid displacement. Three physicians evaluated segmentation performance via consensus scoring by using a 5-point scale. Dosimetric assessment included measurements of mean heart dose, left ventricular volume receiving 5 Gy, and left anterior descending artery mean and maximum doses. Results: Atlas approaches performed similarly well, with 7 of 13 substructures (heart, chambers, ascending aorta, and pulmonary artery) having DSC >0.75 when averaged over 11 validation patients. Coronary artery segmentations were not successful with the atlas-based approach (mean DSC <0.3). The STAPLE method with 10 matches yielded the highest DSC and the lowest mean distance to agreement for all high-performing substructures (omitting coronary arteries). For the STAPLE method with 10 matches, >50% of all validation contours had centroid displacements <3.0 mm, with the largest shifts in the coronary arteries. Atlas-generated contours had no statistical difference from ground truth for left anterior descending artery maximum dose, mean heart dose, and left ventricular volume receiving 5 Gy (P >.05). Qualitative contour grading showed that 8 substructures required minor modifications. Conclusions: The hybrid MR/CT atlas provided reliable segmentations of chambers, heart, and great vessels for patients undergoing noncontrast CT, suggesting potential widespread applicability for routine treatment planning. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061533028

In a randomized trial, changes in survivor knowledge and satisfaction before and after the receipt of an SCP were assessed. Methods: Patients with breast cancer who had completed curative-intent treatment were randomized to immediate versus delayed receipt of an individualized SCP. All participants completed the modified Wisconsin Survey of Cancer Diagnosis and Management in Breast Cancer and the Preparing for Life As a New Survivor survey to assess individual knowledge about cancer diagnosis, treatment, side effects, and follow-up as well as satisfaction with communication and care coordination. Surveys were completed at baseline, at 4 weeks (before delayed receipt), and again at 12 weeks (after all participants had received SCPs); the primary outcome was change in knowledge at 4 weeks. Results: In total, 127 eligible women were randomized. An improvement in individual knowledge was observed between baseline and week 12 for both arms combined (+1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.3; P <.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the change in knowledge from baseline through week 4 between the arms. No significant change occurred for satisfaction scores over time. Conclusions: This randomized trial of immediate versus delayed SCP receipt demonstrated a small improvement (4%) in survivor knowledge. However, this improvement did not appear to be related to SCP provision. The authors hypothesized that the improvement was because of repeated administration of the knowledge survey. If improved survivor knowledge is a goal, then strategies beyond the 1-time provision and review of an SCP should be explored. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85060796737

We describe a novel, simulation-based prediction method that is founded on a realistic model for the underlying processes of recruitment. The model reflects key features of enrollment such as the staggered initiation of new centers, heterogeneity in enrollment capacity, and declining accrual within centers. The model's first stage assumes that centers join the trial (ie, initiate accrual) according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process in discrete time. The second part assumes that each center's enrollment pattern reflects an early plateau followed by a slow decline, with a burst at the end of the trial following the announcement of an imminent closing date. By summing up achieved and projected enrollment, one can predict accrual as a function of time and, thereby, the time when the trial will achieve a planned enrollment target. We applied our method retrospectively to two real-world trials: NSABP B-38 and REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure). In both studies, the proposed method produced prediction intervals for time to completion that were more accurate than those from conventional predictions that assume a constant rate of enrollment, estimated either from the entire trial to date or over a recent time window. The advantage is substantial in the early stages of NSABP B-38. We conclude that a method based on a realistic accrual model offers improved accuracy in the prediction of enrollment landmarks, especially at the early stages of large trials that involve many centers. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056191684

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary intake and BC risk in black South African women. The study population included 396 BC cases and 396 population-based controls matched on age and residence, participating in the South African Breast Cancer study. Diet was assessed using a validated quantified FFQ from which twelve energy-adjusted food groups were formed and analysed. OR were estimated using conditional logistic regressions, adjusted for confounding factors, comparing highest v. lowest median intake. Fresh fruit consumption showed an inverse association with BC risk (OR=0·3, 95 % CI 0·12, 0·80) in premenopausal women, whilst red and organ meat consumption showed an overall inverse association with BC risk (OR=0·6, 95 % CI 0·49, 0·94 and OR=0·6, 95 % CI 0·47, 0·91). Savoury food consumption (sauces, soups and snacks) were positively associated with BC risk in postmenopausal women (OR=2·1, 95 % CI 1·15, 4·07). Oestrogen receptor-positive stratification showed an inverse association with BC risk and consumption of nuts and seeds (OR=0·2, 95 % CI 0·58, 0·86). Based on these results, it is recommended that black South African women follow a diet with more fruit and vegetables together with a decreased consumption of less energy-dense, micronutrient-poor foods such as savoury foods. More research is necessary to investigate the association between BC risk and red and organ meat consumption. Affordable and practical methods regarding these recommendations should be implemented within health intervention strategies. © The Authors 2019 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060943297

We report that fibrin-mediated angiogenesis was inhibited and tumor growth delayed following postnatal deletion of Tgfbr2 in the endothelium of Cdh5-CreERT2 Tgfbr2fl/fl mice (Tgfbr2iECKO mice). ECs from Tgfbr2iECKO mice failed to upregulate the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (Serpine1, also known as PAI-1), due in part to uncoupled TGF-β-mediated suppression of miR-30c. Bypassing TGF-β signaling with vascular tropic nanoparticles that deliver miR-30c antagomiRs promoted PAI-1-dependent tumor growth and increased fibrin abundance, whereas miR-30c mimics inhibited tumor growth and promoted vascular-directed fibrinolysis in vivo. Using single-cell RNA-Seq and a NanoString miRNA array, we also found that subtypes of ECs in tumors showed spectrums of Serpine1 and miR-30c expression levels, suggesting functional diversity in ECs at the level of individual cells; indeed, fresh EC isolates from lung and mammary tumor models had differential abilities to degrade fibrin and launch new vessel sprouts, a finding that was linked to their inverse expression patterns of miR-30c and Serpine1 (i.e., miR-30chi Serpine1lo ECs were poorly angiogenic and miR-30clo Serpine1hi ECs were highly angiogenic). Thus, by balancing Serpine1 expression in ECs downstream of TGF-β, miR-30c functions as a tumor suppressor in the tumor microenvironment through its ability to promote fibrin degradation and inhibit blood vessel formation.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062716892

We investigated the relationships between PTGS2 expression, celecoxib use during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and both event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 156 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative breast cancer from the REMAGUS02 (ISRCTN Registry No. 10059974) trial with pretreatment PTGS2 expression data. Patients were treated by sequential NAC (epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel with or without celecoxib). Experimental validation was performed on breast cancer cell lines. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 30801 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01041781) trial that tested chemotherapy with or without celecoxib in patients with lung cancer served as an independent validation cohort. RESULTS: After 94.5 months of follow-up, EFS was significantly lower in the celecoxib group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1 to 2.88; P = .046). A significant interaction between PTGS2 expression and celecoxib use was detected ( Pinteraction = .01). In the PTGS2-low group (n = 100), EFS was lower in the celecoxib arm (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.45 to 6.24; P = .002) than in the standard treatment arm. Celecoxib use was an independent predictor of poor EFS, distant relapse-free survival, and OS. Celecoxib in addition to docetaxel enhanced cell viability in PTGS2-low cell lines but not in PTGS2-high cell lines. In CALGB 30801, a trend toward poorer progression-free survival was observed in the patients with low urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2 who received celecoxib (HR = 1.57; 95% CI, 0.87 to 2.84; P = .13). CONCLUSION: Celecoxib use during chemotherapy adversely affected survival in patients with breast cancer, and the effect was more marked in PTGS2-low and/or estrogen receptor-negative tumors. COX-2 inhibitors should preferably be avoided during docetaxel use in patients with breast cancer who are undergoing NAC.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062616322

However, individual cancers vary in their adherence to a prototype, and due to bulk tissue sampling, some may exhibit expression patterns that indicate intra-tumor admixture of multiple subtypes. Our objective was to develop admixture metrics from PAM50 gene expression profiles in order to stratify Luminal A (LumA) cases according to their degree of subtype admixture, and then relate such admixture to clinical and molecular variables. Methods: We re-constructed scaled, normalized PAM50 profiles for 1980 cases (674 LumA) in the METABRIC cohort and for each case computed its Mahalanobis (M-) distance from its assigned centroid and M-distance from all other centroids. We used t-SNE plots to visualize overlaps in subtype clustering. With Normal-like cases excluded, we developed two metrics: Median Distance Criteria (MDC) classified pure cases as those located within the 50th percentile of the LumA centroid and > =50th percentile from any other centroid. Distance Ratio Criteria (DRC) was computed as the ratio of M-distances from the LumA centroid to the nearest non-assigned centroid. Pure and admixed LumA cases were compared on clinical/molecular traits. TCGA LumA cases (n = 509) provided independent validation. Results: Compared to pure cases in METABRIC, admixed ones had older age at diagnosis, larger tumor size, and higher grade and stage. These associations were stronger for the DRC metric compared to MDC. Admixed cases were associated with HER2 gain, high proliferation, higher PAM50 recurrence scores, more frequent TP53 mutation, and less frequent PIK3CA mutation. Similar results were observed in the TCGA validation cohort, which also showed a positive association between admixture and number of clonal populations estimated by PyClone. LumA-LumB confusion predominated, but other combinations were also present. Degree of admixture was associated with overall survival in both cohorts, as was disease-free survival in TCGA, independent of age, grade and stage (HR = 2.85, Tertile 3 vs.1). Conclusions: Luminal A breast cancers subgrouped based on PAM50 subtype purity support the hypothesis that admixed cases have worse clinical features and survival. Future analyses will explore more extensive genomic metrics for admixture and their spatial significance within a single tumor. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062636259

We explored the feasibility of offering a short-term intervention of low-dose oral tamoxifen to women with high BPU and examined whether this intervention would reduce BPU. Methods: Women with a history of high BPU and no breast cancer history were invited to the study. Participants had an MBI exam, followed by 30 days of low-dose oral tamoxifen at either 5 mg or 10 mg/day, and a post-tamoxifen MBI exam. BPU on pre- A nd post-tamoxifen MBI exams was quantitatively assessed as the ratio of average counts in breast fibroglandular tissue vs. average counts in subcutaneous fat. Pre-tamoxifen and post-tamoxifen BPU were compared with paired t tests. Results: Of 47 women invited, 22 enrolled and 21 completed the study (10 taking 5 mg tamoxifen, 11 taking 10 mg tamoxifen). Mean age was 47.7 years (range 41-56 years). After 30 days low-dose tamoxifen, 8 of 21 women (38%) showed a decline in BPU, defined as a decrease from the pre-tamoxifen MBI of at least 15%; 11 of 21 (52%) had no change in BPU (within ± 15%); 2 of 21 (10%) had an increase in BPU of greater than 15%. Overall, the average post-tamoxifen BPU was not significantly different from pre-tamoxifen BPU (1.34 post vs. 1.43 pre, p = 0.11). However, among women taking 10 mg tamoxifen, 5 of 11 (45%) showed a decline in BPU; average BPU was 1.19 post-tamoxifen vs. 1.34 pre-tamoxifen (p = 0.005). In women taking 5 mg tamoxifen, 2 of 10 (20%) showed a decline in BPU; average BPU was 1.51 post-tamoxifen vs.1.53 pre-tamoxifen (p = 0.99). Conclusions: Short-term intervention with low-dose tamoxifen may reduce high BPU on MBI for some patients. Our preliminary findings suggest that 10 mg tamoxifen per day may be more effective than 5 mg for inducing declines in BPU within 30 days. Given the variability in BPU response to tamoxifen observed among study participants, future study is warranted to determine if BPU response could predict the effectiveness of tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction within an individual.

We hypothesized that the immunological responses to p53MVA vaccine may require additional immune checkpoint blockade to achieve clinically beneficial levels. We therefore conducted a phase I trial evaluating the combination of p53MVA and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients and methods: Eleven patients with advanced breast, pancreatic, hepatocellular, or head and neck cancer received up to 3 triweekly vaccines in combination with pembrolizumab given concurrently and thereafter, alone at 3-week intervals until disease progression. The patients were assessed for toxicity and clinical response. Correlative studies analyzed p53-reactive T cells and profile of immune function gene expression. Results: We observed clinical responses in 3/11 patients who remained with stable disease for 30, 32, and 49 weeks. Two of these patients showed increased frequencies and persistence of p53-reactive CD8 + T cells and elevation of expression of multiple immune response genes. Borderline or undetectable p53-specific T cell responses in 7/11 patients were related to no immediate clinical benefit. The first study patient had a grade 5 fatal myocarditis. After the study was amended for enhanced cardiac monitoring, no additional cardiac toxicities were noted. Conclusion: We have shown that the combination of p53MVA vaccine with pembrolizumab is feasible, safe, and may offer clinical benefit in select group of patients that should be identified through further studies. © 2018, Federación de Sociedades Españolas de Oncología (FESEO).","Final",,2-s2.0-85051294806

Social media platforms, such as blogs written by mothers, are increasingly being recognized as a channel that women use to make personal and family health-related decisions. Government initiatives (eg, Interagency Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Coordinating Committee) and researchers have called for scientists and the community to partner and disseminate scientifically and community-informed environmental risk information. OBJECTIVE: We developed and evaluated a blog intervention to disseminate breast cancer and environmental risk information to mothers. We teamed with mommy bloggers to disseminate a message that we developed and tailored for mothers and daughters based on scientific evidence from the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP). We posited that the intervention would influence women's exposure to, acceptance of, and beliefs about environmental risks while promoting their intention to adopt risk-reducing behaviors. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design, we recruited 75 mommy bloggers to disseminate the breast cancer risk message on their respective blogs and examined the impact of the intervention on (1) readers exposed to the intervention (n=445) and (2) readers not exposed to the intervention (comparison group; n=353). RESULTS: Following the intervention, blog reader scores indicating exposure to the breast cancer risk and prevention information were greater than scores of blog readers who were not exposed (or did not recall seeing the message; mean 3.92, SD 0.85 and mean 3.45, SD 0.92, respectively; P<.001). Readers who recalled the intervention messages also had higher breast cancer risk and prevention information satisfaction scores compared with readers who did not see (or recall) the messages (mean 3.97, SD 0.75 and mean 3.57, SD 0.94, respectively; P<.001). Blog readers who recalled seeing the intervention messages were significantly more likely to share the breast cancer risk and prevention information they read, with their daughters specifically, than readers who did not recall seeing them (χ21=8.1; P=.004). Those who recalled seeing the intervention messages reported significantly higher breast cancer risk and prevention information influence scores, indicative of behavioral intentions, than participants who did not recall seeing them (mean 11.22, SD 2.93 and mean 10.14, SD 3.24, respectively; P=.003). Most women ranked Facebook as their first choice for receiving breast cancer risk information. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that blog readers who were exposed to (and specifically recalled) the BCERP-adapted intervention messages from mommy bloggers had higher breast cancer risk and prevention information exposure scores and higher breast cancer risk and prevention information satisfaction and influence scores than those who did not see (or recall) them. Mommy bloggers may be important opinion leaders for some women and key to enhancing the messaging, delivery, and impact of environmental breast cancer risk information on mothers. ©Kevin Wright, Carla Fisher, Camella Rising, Amelia Burke-Garcia, Dasha Afanaseva, Xiaomei Cai.

Consequently, patients diagnosed with TNBCs have reduced overall and disease-free survival rates compared to patients with other subtypes of breast cancer. TNBCs are characterized by the presence of cancer cells with mesenchymal properties, indicating that the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a major role in the progression of this disease. The EMT program has also been implicated in chemoresistance, tumor recurrence, and induction of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for TNBC, and hence, it is critical to identify the novel targets to treat TNBC. Methods: A library of compounds was screened for their ability to inhibit EMT in cells with mesenchymal phenotype as assessed using the previously described Z-cad reporters. Of the several drugs tested, GSK3β inhibitors were identified as EMT inhibitors. The effects of GSK3β inhibitors on the properties of TNBC cells with a mesenchymal phenotype were assessed using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, western blot, mammosphere, and migration and cell viability assays. Publicly available datasets also were analyzed to examine if the expression of GSK3β correlates with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. Results: We identified a GSK3β inhibitor, BIO, in a drug screen as one of the most potent inhibitors of EMT. BIO and two other GSK3β inhibitors, TWS119 and LiCl, also decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers in several different cell lines with a mesenchymal phenotype. Further, inhibition of GSK3β reduced EMT-related migratory properties of cells with mesenchymal properties. To determine if GSK3β inhibitors target mesenchymal-like cells by affecting the CSC population, we employed mammosphere assays and profiled the stem cell-related cell surface marker CD44? in cells after exposure to GSK3β inhibitors. We found that GSK3β inhibitors indeed decreased the CSC properties of cell types with mesenchymal properties. We treated cells with epithelial and mesenchymal properties with GSK3β inhibitors and found that GSK3β inhibitors selectively kill cells with mesenchymal attributes while sparing cells with epithelial properties. We analyzed patient data to identify genes predictive of poor clinical outcome that could serve as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC. The Wnt signaling pathway is critical to EMT, but among the various factors known to be involved in Wnt signaling, only the higher expression of GSK3β correlated with poorer overall patient survival. Conclusions: Taken together, our data demonstrate that GSK3β is a potential target for TNBCs and suggest that GSK3β inhibitors could serve as selective inhibitors of EMT and CSC properties for the treatment of a subset of aggressive TNBC. GSK3β inhibitors should be tested for use in combination with standard-of-care drugs in preclinical TNBC models. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062552666

The contribution of genetic factors to this risk is unclear. We therefore examined 211 155 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for gene-radiation interaction on breast cancer risk in a case-only analysis including 327 breast cancer patients after chest RT for HL and 4671 first primary breast cancer patients. Nine SNPs showed statistically significant interaction with RT on breast cancer risk (false discovery rate, <20%), of which 1 SNP in the PVT1 oncogene attained the Bonferroni threshold for statistical significance. A polygenic risk score (PRS) composed of these SNPs (RT-interaction-PRS) and a previously published breast cancer PRS (BC-PRS) derived in the general population were evaluated in a case-control analysis comprising the 327 chest-irradiated HL patients with breast cancer and 491 chest-irradiated HL patients without breast cancer. Patients in the highest tertile of the RT-interaction-PRS had a 1.6-fold higher breast cancer risk than those in the lowest tertile. Remarkably, we observed a fourfold increased RT-induced breast cancer risk in the highest compared with the lowest decile of the BC-PRS. On a continuous scale, breast cancer risk increased 1.4-fold per standard deviation of the BC-PRS, similar to the effect size found in the general population. This study demonstrates that genetic factors influence breast cancer risk after chest RT for HL. Given the high absolute breast cancer risk in radiation-exposed women, these results can have important implications for the management of current HL survivors and future patients. © 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062600362

Experimental preclinical models that recapitulate their tumors of origin can accelerate target identification, thereby potentially improving therapeutic efficacy. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), due to their genomic and transcriptomic fidelity to the tumors from which they are derived, are poised to improve the preclinical testing of drug-target combinations in translational models. Despite the previous development of breast and TNBC PDX models, those derived from patients with demonstrated health-disparities are lacking. Methods: We use an aggressive TNBC PDX model propagated in SCID/Beige mice that was established from an African-American woman, TU-BcX-2 K1, and assess its metastatic potential and drug sensitivities under distinct in vitro conditions. Cellular derivatives of the primary tumor or the PDX were grown in 2D culture conditions or grown in mammospheres 3D culture. Flow cytometry and fluorescence staining was used to quantify cancer stem cell-like populations. qRT-PCR was used to describe the mesenchymal gene signature of the tumor. The sensitivity of TU-BcX-2 K1-derived cells to anti-neoplastic oncology drugs was compared in adherent cells and mammospheres. Drug response was evaluated using a live/dead staining kit and crystal violet staining. Results: TU-BcX-2 K1 has a low propensity for metastasis, reflects a mesenchymal state, and contains a large burden of cancer stem cells. We show that TU-BcX-2 K1 cells have differential responses to cytotoxic and targeted therapies in 2D compared to 3D culture conditions insofar as several drug classes conferred sensitivity in 2D but not in 3D culture, or cells grown as mammospheres. Conclusions: Here we introduce a new TNBC PDX model and demonstrate the differences in evaluating drug sensitivity in adherent cells compared to mammosphere, or suspension, culture. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062593098

Since then, the genetic properties that define the cancer cells have been heavily investigated; however, genomic mediators within the organ microenvironment that mediate successful metastatic growth are less understood. These studies sought to identify cancer- and organ-specific genomic programs that mediate metastasis. Methods: In these studies, a set of 14 human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) metastasis models was developed and then tested for metastatic tropism with two approaches: spontaneous metastases from mammary tumors and intravenous injection of PDX cells. The transcriptomes of the cancer cells when growing as tumors or metastases were separated from the transcriptomes of the microenvironment via species-specific separation of the genomes. Drug treatment of PDX spheroids was performed to determine if genes activated in metastases may identify targetable mediators of viability. Results: The experimental approaches that generated metastases in PDX models were identified. RNA sequencing of 134 tumors, metastases, and normal non-metastatic organs identified cancer- and organ-specific genomic properties that mediated metastasis. A common genomic response of the liver microenvironment was found to occur in reaction to the invading PDX cells. Genes within the cancer cells were found to be either transiently regulated by the microenvironment or permanently altered due to clonal selection of metastatic sublines. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses identified more than 400 gene signatures that were commonly activated in metastases across basal-like PDXs. A Src signaling signature was found to be extensively upregulated in metastases, and Src inhibitors were found to be cytotoxic to PDX spheroids. Conclusions: These studies identified that during the growth of breast cancer metastases, there were genomic changes that occurred within both the cancer cells and the organ microenvironment. We hypothesize that pathways upregulated in metastases are mediators of viability and that simultaneously targeting changes within different cancer cell pathways and/or different tissue compartments may be needed for inhibition of disease progression. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062526043

Its use is associated with the development of severe diarrhea in up to 40% of patients in the absence of proactive management. We previously developed a rat model of neratinib-induced diarrhea and found inflammation and anatomical disruption in the ileum and colon. Here we tested whether anti-diarrheal interventions, budesonide and colesevelam, can reduce neratinib-induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology. Methods: Rats were treated with 50 mg/kg neratinib via oral gavage for 14 or 28 days (total n = 64). Body weight and diarrhea severity were recorded daily. Apoptosis was measured using immunohistochemistry for caspase-3. Inflammation was measured via a multiplex cytokine/chemokine assay. ErbB levels were measured using PCR and Western Blot. Results: Budesonide co-treatment caused rats to gain significantly less weight than neratinib alone from day 4 of treatment (P = 0.0418). Budesonide (P = 0.027) and colesevelam (P = 0.033) each reduced the amount of days with moderate diarrhea compared to neratinib alone. In the proximal colon, rats treated with neratinib had higher levels of apoptosis compared to controls (P = 0.0035). Budesonide reduced histopathological injury in the proximal (P = 0.0401) and distal colon (P = 0.027) and increased anti-inflammatory IL-4 tissue concentration (ileum; P = 0.0026, colon; P = 0.031) compared to rats treated with neratinib alone. In the distal ileum, while budesonide decreased ErbB1 mRNA expression compared to controls (P = 0.018) (PCR), an increase in total ErbB1 protein was detected (P = 0.0021) (Western Blot).

The clinical response to CKB is associated with T cell immunity targeting cancer-induced mutations that generate novel HLA-binding epitopes (neoepitopes). Methods: Here, we developed a rapid bioinformatics pipeline and filtering strategy, EpitopeHunter, to identify and prioritize clinically relevant neoepitopes from the landscape of somatic mutations. We used the pipeline to determine the frequency of neoepitopes from the TCGA dataset of invasive breast cancers. We predicted HLA class I-binding neoepitopes for 870 breast cancer samples and filtered the neoepitopes based on tumor transcript abundance. Results: We found that the total mutational burden (TMB) was highest for triple-negative breast cancer, TNBC, (median = 63 mutations, range: 2-765); followed by HER-2(+) (median = 39 mutations, range: 1-1206); and lowest for ER/PR(+)HER-2(-) (median = 32 mutations, range: 1-2860). 40% of the nonsynonymous mutations led to the generation of predicted neoepitopes. The neoepitope load (NEL) is highly correlated with the mutational burden (R 2 = 0.86). Conclusions: Only half (51%) of the predicted neoepitopes are expressed at the RNA level (FPKM≥2), indicating the importance of assessing whether neoepitopes are transcribed. However, of all patients, 93% have at least one expressed predicted neoepitope, indicating that most breast cancer patients have the potential for neo-epitope targeted immunotherapy. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",,2-s2.0-85062420316

This study described impact of bone metastases, utilization of bone-targeted agents (BTAs) and physicians’ decision processes for BTA use in advanced breast cancer. Methods: Data were collected using the Adelphi Breast Cancer Disease-Specific Programme in the United States. Physicians completed a detailed record for eligible patients (women ≥18 years, with stage IIIB–IV breast cancer). Results: Data available from 1276 patients with advanced breast cancer included 485 (38%) with bone metastases. Most (80%) reported pain at bone metastasis diagnosis; of those reporting pain, 55% reported moderate to severe pain. Among patients with bone metastasis, 69% received a BTA. Reasons for initiating BTAs were bone pain (32%) and an estimated high risk of SREs (25%). Reasons for not treating with BTAs were very recent diagnosis (37%), poor Karnofsky performance status (14%), perceived low risk of SREs (11%) and short life expectancy (11%). Zoledronic acid (48%) and denosumab (42%) were commonly used BTAs; the main reasons for initiating BTA treatment were long-term safety (28% and 32%, respectively) and efficacy in delaying SREs (15% and 31%, respectively).

We sought to detail the effect of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibition on the composition of the mammary tumor immune portfolio. We hypothesized that Hh signaling mediates a crosstalk between breast cancer cells and macrophages that dictates alternative polarization of macrophages and consequently supports a tumor-promoting microenvironment. We used an immunocompetent, syngeneic mouse mammary cancer model to inhibit Hh signaling with the pharmacological inhibitor, Vismodegib. Using molecular and functional assays, we identified that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling mediates a molecular crosstalk between mammary cancer cells and macrophages that culminates in alternative polarization of macrophages. We carried out an unbiased kinomics and genomics assessment to unravel changes in global kinomic and gene signatures impacted by Hh signaling. Our investigations reveal that in an immunocompetent mammary cancer model, the administration of Vismodegib led to changes in the portfolio of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This was characterized by a marked reduction in immune-suppressive innate and adaptive cells concomitant with an enrichment of cytotoxic immune cells. Breast cancer cells induce M2 polarization of macrophages via a crosstalk mediated by Hh ligands that alters critical kinomic and genomic signatures. Macrophage depletion improved the benefit of Hedgehog inhibition on eliciting an immunogenic, pro-inflammatory profile. We define a novel role for Hh signaling in disabling anti-tumor immunity. Inhibition of Hh signaling presents with dual advantages of tumor cell-targeting as well as re-educating a dysfunctional tumor microenvironment. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

TP is found to be elevated in tumor cells in comparison to normal cells, which consequently tumor-localizes the production of 5-FU, thereby limiting its systemic toxicity. Today, capecitabine is extensively used for the treatment of many solid malignancies, with a particular focus in breast and gastrointestinal tumors, but also in pancreatic cancer. Areas covered: This review summarizes the pharmacology and the clinical evidence relevant to the use of capecitabine in the treatment of pancreas cancer. The authors provide, furthermore, provide their expert perspectives on its use. Expert opinion: Capecitabine has the advantage over other therapeutics in so much that it has both convenient oral administration and a favorable toxicity profile. Current data has promised the use of capecitabine in all stages of pancreatic cancer.

In solid tumors, immune cells and antibodies need to extravasate from vasculature, find the tumor, and migrate through a dense mass of cells. These multiple steps pose significant obstacles for solid tumor immunotherapy and their study has remained difficult using classic in vitro models based on Petri dishes. In this work, a microfluidic model has been developed to study natural killer cell response. The model includes a 3D breast cancer spheroid in a 3D extracellular matrix, and two flanking lumens lined with endothelial cells, replicating key structures and components during the immune response. Natural Killer cells and antibodies targeting the tumor cells were either embedded in the matrix or perfused through the lateral blood vessels. Antibodies that were perfused through the lateral lumens extravasated out of the blood vessels and rapidly diffused through the matrix. However, tumor cell-cell junctions hindered antibody penetration within the spheroid. On the other hand, natural killer cells were able to detect the presence of the tumor spheroid several hundreds of microns away and penetrate the spheroid faster than the antibodies. Once inside the spheroid, natural killer cells were able to destroy tumor cells at the spheroid periphery and, importantly, also at the innermost layers. Finally, the combination of antibody-cytokine conjugates and natural killer cells led to an enhanced cytotoxicity located mostly at the spheroid periphery. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of the model for informing immunotherapy of solid tumors. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058648725

Methods: Current members of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation’s Army of Women cohort were sent one email with a link to a survey assessing how their breast cancer diagnosis was communicated, a description of their support system during treatment, basic demographic information, and breast cancer diagnosis details. Results: Participants (n = 2896) were more likely to be given their diagnosis over the telephone in more recent years (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.08). Up until about 10 years ago (1967–2006), breast cancer diagnoses were communicated in person more often than by telephone. Since 2006, more than half of participants learned about their diagnosis over the telephone. From 2015 to 2017, almost 60% of participants learned about their diagnosis over the telephone. Among those who heard the news in person, a steady 40% were alone. Characteristics of those who received the news over the telephone included having identified support members, heterosexual identity, and a diagnosis of in situ breast cancer. Conclusions: Receiving a telephone call about breast cancer diagnosis may be the norm rather than the exception in health care today. Trends in practice, as well as current best practices based primarily on expert opinion, may not provide optimal care for women diagnosed with breast cancer.

With various limitations and adverse effects of current therapies, several immunotherapies are being explored. Development of an effective breast cancer vaccine can be a groundbreaking immunotherapeutic approach. Such approaches are being evaluated by several clinical trials currently. On similar lines, our research study aims to evaluate a particulate breast cancer vaccine delivered via skin. This particulate breast cancer vaccine was prepared by spray drying technique and utilized murine breast cancer whole cell lysate as a source of tumor-associated antigens. The average size of the particulate vaccine was 1.5 μm, which resembled the pathogenic species, thereby assisting in phagocytosis and antigen presentation leading to further activation of the immune response. The particulate vaccine was delivered via skin using commercially available metal microneedles. Methylene blue staining and confocal microscopy were used to visualize the microchannels. The results showed that microneedles created aqueous conduits of 50 ± 10 μm to deliver the microparticulate vaccine to the skin layers. Further, an in vivo comparison of immune response depicted significantly higher concentration of serum IgG, IgG2a, and B and T cell (CD4+ and CD8+) populations in the vaccinated animals than the control animals (p < 0.001). Upon challenge with live murine breast cancer cells, the vaccinated animals showed five times more tumor suppression than the control animals confirming the immune response activation and protection (p < 0.001).

Chronic stress-induced epinephrine activated LDHA to generate lactate, and the adjusted pH directed USP28-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of MYC. The SLUG promoter was then activated by MYC, which promoted development of breast cancer stem-like traits. Using a drug screen that targeted LDHA, we found that a chronic stress-induced cancer stem-like phenotype could be reversed by vitamin C. These findings demonstrated the critical importance of psychological factors in promoting stem-like properties in breast cancer cells. Thus, the LDHA-lowering agent vitamin C can be a potential approach for combating stress-associated breast cancer.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062409120

We examined the prevalence and content of communication about sexual health between breast cancer patients and clinicians. Methods: Female breast cancer patients being seen in oncology clinic follow-up had a clinic visit audio recorded and self-reported sexual problems after the visit. Transcripts were coded for sexual health communication; data were analyzed descriptively or using Chi-square tests. Results: We recorded 67 patients (81% participation rate) interacting with one of 7 cancer clinicians (5 physicians; 2 advanced practice clinicians). Approximately 1/3 of women (n = 22) reported sexual problems; sexual health communication occurred with 10/22 of those women (45%). Across all 67 patients, 27 (40%) visits contained communication about sexual health. Seventy-percent of sexual health communication was clinician-initiated. When in-depth sexual health discussions occurred, the most common topics discussed were sexual inactivity (6), body image (5), vaginal dryness (4), and safety of sexual activity (2). Conclusion: Communication about sexual health was uncommon even for women reporting sexual problems and was largely initiated by clinicians. Practice implications: Because women with breast cancer often do not raise sexual concerns during clinic visits, breast cancer clinicians should raise the topic of sexual health for all patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054426081

It is not clear whether current BRCA screening guidelines are effective at identifying these patients. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of inherited BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in a large, clinically representative breast cancer cohort and to estimate the proportion of BRCA1/2 carriers not detected by selectively screening individuals with the highest probability of being carriers according to current clinical guidelines. The study included 5,122 unselected Swedish breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2008. Target sequence enrichment (48.48 Fluidigm Access Arrays) and sequencing were performed (Illumina Hi-Seq 2,500 instrument, v4 chemistry). Differences in patient and tumor characteristics of BRCA1/2 carriers who were already identified as part of clinical BRCA1/2 testing routines and additional BRCA1/2 carriers found by sequencing the entire study population were compared using logistic regression models. Ninety-two of 5,099 patients with valid variant calls were identified as BRCA1/2 carriers by screening all study participants (1.8%). Only 416 study participants (8.2%) were screened as part of clinical practice, but this identified 35 out of 92 carriers (38.0%). Clinically identified carriers were younger, less likely postmenopausal and more likely to be associated with familiar ovarian cancer compared to the additional carriers identified by screening all patients. More BRCA2 (34/42, 81.0%) than BRCA1 carriers (23/50, 46%) were missed by clinical screening. In conclusion, BRCA1/2 mutation prevalence in unselected breast cancer patients was 1.8%.

Secondary objectives were to assess clinical and pathologic factors associated with patterns of NR and survival rates. Methods and Materials: Patients with NR after treatment at a single cancer center during 1998 to 2013 were identified. Patients with prior distant metastases or NR without correlative imaging were excluded. All NRs were overlaid onto representative axial computed tomographic images. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify clinical and pathologic characteristics associated with NR. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to assess the rate of relapse by nodal region according to pathologic feature or radiation treatment status. Results: The locations of 243 NRs among 153 eligible patients were mapped. The majority of NR occurred in the axilla (42%; 102/243), followed by the IMN (32.5%; 79/243) and the SCV (25.5%; 62/243). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) or European Society for Radiation therapy and Oncology (ESTRO) clinical target volume encompassed 82% (198/243) of NRs. The majority of out-of-field NRs were located in the lateral and posterior SCV region for both RTOG (67%; 30/45) and ESTRO (89%; 49/55) guidelines. The high-risk patients who received regional RT to the SCV relapsed at a similar rate in the medial, but a higher rate in lateral SCV (P =.009), compared with low-risk patients who received no nodal RT. Lymphovascular invasion most strongly associated with IMN NR (P =.001); grade 3 disease highly associated with both IMN (P =.001) and SCV NR (P =.02). The presence of an IMN NR portended for significantly inferior overall survival (OS), compared with an axillary NR, with a 5-year OS of 59% versus 72%, respectively (P =.03). Conclusions: In this 3-dimensional image-based analysis of NR patterns in breast cancer patients treated with contemporary therapies, the lateral and posterior SCV represented a distinct site of NR that is not routinely included within current breast cancer contouring atlases. Grade 3 breast cancer and LVI were most commonly associated with the development of NR in the SCV. Modifying the CTV to encompass the lateral and posterior SCV in patients with breast cancer with these features might be justified. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060484207

The objective of this study was to evaluate RS validity in a group of older women with ER-positive breast cancer. Methods: Utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database with available RS, we evaluated women with ER-positive breast cancer aged 18–69 and those 70 years of age and older from 2004 to 2014. We utilized multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with RS testing as well as a high-risk categorization for those who underwent testing. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We identified 363,876 women aged 18–69 years and 147,107 women aged 70 years and older. A smaller proportion of patients in the older group (8%) underwent RS testing than in the younger group (18%). Of the patients who underwent testing, distribution of RS was similar between groups. High-risk categorization independently predicted a higher likelihood of death for older patients (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15–1.90). Among patients with high-risk RS, chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of death in the younger group, but not in the older group. Conclusion: Older women are less likely to receive RS testing, but when tested, older patients have a similar distribution of RS as compared to younger patients. While high-risk categorization in the older cohort was prognostic, chemotherapy was not associated with improved survival. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85050993453

The objective of our study was to determine whether detection rates of specific benign and malignant diagnoses differ for breast cancer screening with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) versus full-field digital mammography (FFDM) alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We analyzed observational data from the Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System, including 86,349 DBT screening examinations and 97,378 FFDM screening examinations performed at eight radiology facilities in Vermont that adopted DBT screening during 2012–2016. We determined the most severe diagnosis made within 6 months after positive screening examinations. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to compare detection rates for specific diagnoses on DBT versus FFDM. RESULTS. Compared with FFDM, DBT had a lower recall rate (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77–0.85) but comparable biopsy rate (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93–1.17), benign biopsy rate (OR = 1.12; 95% CI, 0.97–1.29), and cancer detection rate (OR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78–1.14). Among benign diagnoses, DBT and FFDM had comparable detection rates for nonproliferative lesions (OR = 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92–1.53), fibroepithelial proliferations (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.85–1.81), proliferative lesions without atypia (OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 0.90–1.42), atypical lesions (OR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.43–1.38), and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.53–1.61). Among malignant diagnoses, DBT and FFDM had comparable detection rates for ductal carcinoma in situ (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.70–1.57) and invasive breast cancer (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74–1.13), with no statistically significant differences in detection of invasive ductal carcinoma (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66–1.06), invasive lobular carcinoma (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.59–2.07), or invasive mixed ductal-lobular carcinoma (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 0.65–3.39).

Quadruple negative tumors, which are TNBC tumors that lack androgen receptor (AR), represent a more aggressive subtype of TNBC; however, the molecular features are not well understood. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and AR was determined in 244 primary and 630 recurrent/metastatic site biopsies. Expression was correlated with a panel of 25 cancer-related genes and proteins by IHC and in situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: We observed that 80.2% (65 of 81) of primary TNBC tumors and 75.7% (159 of 210) of recurrent/metastatic TNBC tumors are QNBC. Bivariate fit analysis demonstrated that QNBC (n = 224) significantly (P <.03) correlated with younger aged patients at initial biopsy compared to AR positive TNBC patients (n = 51). In paired primary tissue samples and primary to recurrent/metastatic samples, at least 70% Luminal, HER2 enriched, and QNBC subtype did not change molecular profile. But, TNBC seems to be the “unstable” subtype. Within the total cohort, discordance in molecular profiles was identified in both synchronous (20%) and asynchronous (21%) intra-individual analyses. Irrespective of sample type, (Synchronous or Asynchronous), QNBC demonstrated higher concordant than TNBC. IHC and ISH results of the cancer related genes, demonstrated that gene/protein expression differ by molecular profile: TNBC (HR-/HER2-, AR+) and QNBC (HR-/HER2-, AR-). IHC in metastatic tumors, showed that the percentage of tumors positive of EGFR were higher, while PTEN and TLE3 were lower in QNBC compared to TNBC. CONCLUSION: Standard treatment of Breast Cancer (BC) relies on reliable assessment by IHC analysis of ER, PR, and HER2. Our analyses suggest that the heterogeneity of TNBC is at least partially associated with the presence or absence of AR expression, suggesting that QNBC should be considered as a clinically relevant BC subtype. IHC analysis of AR appears to be a practical assay to determine the most aggressive TNBC subtypes and identifies tumors that could benefit from available targeted therapies. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059084121

However, whether there are cross talks between these factors to promote breast cancer is still unknown. Using the T47D human breast cancer cell line, we have found that estradiol and progesterone synergistically activate HERV-K through nuclear receptors. The progesterone receptor (isoform B) binds a progesterone-response element (PRE) in a long terminal repeat (LTR5HS) of HERV-K. There is another transcription factor-binding element in the LTR, the octamer motif, which is required for the hormones to activate gene transcription downstream of the LTR. Gel shift assays and co-immunoprecipitation indicate that the progesterone receptor (PR) and the OCT4 transcription factor interact on the protein level. Methylation of the PRE enhances binding of the PR. These findings help to elucidate the previously unknown cross talks among the sex hormones, OCT4, and HERVs in contributing to breast cancer proliferation and tumorigenesis, which may be useful in guiding further development of cancer therapies. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062407455

The addition of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) significantly improves diagnostic accuracy. This study aims to clarify which descriptors from DCE-MRI, DWI, and T 2 -weighted imaging are most strongly associated with a breast cancer diagnosis. Purpose/Hypothesis: To develop a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) model for breast cancer diagnosis incorporating American College of Radiology (ACR) BI-RADS recommended descriptors for breast MRI with DCE, T 2 -weighted imaging, and DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. Study Type: Retrospective. Subjects: In all, 188 patients (mean 51.6 years) with 210 breast tumors (136 malignant and 74 benign) who underwent mpMRI from December 2010 to September 2014. Field Strength/Sequence: IR inversion recovert DCE-MRI dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging VIBE Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination FLASH turbo fast-low-angle-shot TWIST Time-resolved angiography with stochastic Trajectories. Assessment: Two radiologists in consensus and another radiologist independently evaluated the mpMRI data. Characteristics for mass (n = 182) and nonmass (n = 28) lesions were recorded on DCE and T 2 -weighted imaging according to BI-RADS, as well as DWI descriptors. Two separate models were analyzed, using DCE-MRI BI-RADS descriptors, T 2 -weighted imagines, and ADCmean as either a continuous or binary form using a previously published ADC cutoff value of ≤1.25 × 10 −3 mm 2 /sec for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Histopathology was the standard of reference. Statistical Tests: χ 2 test, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal–Wallis test, Pearson correlation coefficient, multivariate logistic regression analysis, Hosmer–Lemeshow test of goodness-of-fit, receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results: In Model 1, ADCmean (P = 0.0031), mass margins with DCE (P = 0.0016), and delayed enhancement with DCE (P = 0.0016) were significantly and independently associated with breast cancer diagnosis; Model 2 identified ADCmean (P = 0.0031), mass margins with DCE (P = 0.0012), initial enhancement (P = 0.0422), and delayed enhancement with DCE (P = 0.0065) to be significantly independently associated with breast cancer diagnosis. T 2 -weighted imaging variables were not included in the final models. Data Conclusion: mpMRI with DCE-MRI and DWI with ADC mapping enables accurate breast cancer diagnosis. A model using quantitative and qualitative descriptors from DCE-MRI and DWI identifies breast cancer with a high diagnostic accuracy. T 2 -weighted imaging does not significantly contribute to breast cancer diagnosis. Level of Evidence: 3. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;49:864–874. © 2018 The Authors.

Case Report: Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old woman with metastatic luminal breast cancer that rapidly responded to monotherapy with pembrolizumab, a monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody. This patient obtained a partial clinical response within the first cycle of treatment and an ongoing durable complete remission after 12 weeks. Except for a transient immune-related thyreoiditis, there were no side effects observed offering remarkable quality of life to the patient. To evaluate the underlying mechanisms, we performed immunohistochemistry, explored the mutational landscape by whole-exome sequencing, and identified potential T-cell epitopes by prediction of neoantigens with high affinity binding to one of the patient's HLA. Briefly, we found a strong infiltration of CD8+ T cells without staining for PD-L1 in the tumor stroma. Exome sequencing revealed an enormous frequency of somatic and tumor-specific alterations, mainly C>T/G>A transitions. The mutational pattern was further linked to genome instability and deficient mismatch repair supported by the loss of MSH6 protein expression and therefore leading to susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade. Conclusion: Within the overall goal to establish operating procedures for breast cancer immunotherapy, we propose to re-evaluate testing for deficient mismatch repair and to further intensify the search for biomarkers predictive for the success of immune checkpoint modulation including all tumor biologic subtypes of breast cancer. © 2018 S.

This study prospectively examined longitudinal trends in perceived social support in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer as a function of depression status prior to initiation of cancer treatment. Methods: One hundred ten patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 59 age-matched noncancer controls completed behavioral measures at four assessments: prior to treatment and at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-treatment. Participants reported their perceived tangible and emotional/informational support using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey and were categorized as “depressed” or “non-depressed” based on the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). Analyses first compared longitudinal trends in support between patients and controls and then examined differences in longitudinal trends as a function of depression status in patients only, controlling for key covariates. Results: Both tangible and emotional/informational support decreased among breast cancer patients but increased or remained unchanged among noncancer controls across the assessments. Among patients, depressed individuals experienced a significant decline in both tangible (P = 0.004) and emotional/informational support (P = 0.013) between 1 month and 1 year post-treatment, which remained unchanged between 1 year and 2 years post-treatment. In contrast, nondepressed individuals had stable levels across all assessments. Depressed patients also had lower levels of both support types compared with nondepressed patients across all assessments. Conclusions: Breast cancer patients with depressive symptomatology have an elevated risk for declines in perceived social support over time. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061330070

We hypothesised that trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer could be mediated by immune mechanisms. We assessed the safety and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, added to trastuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Methods: We did this single-arm, multicentre, phase 1b–2 trial in 11 centres based in five countries. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older, who had advanced, histologically confirmed, HER2-positive breast cancer; documented progression during previous trastuzumab-based therapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded metastatic tumour biopsy for central assessment of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. In phase 1b, we enrolled patients with PD-L1-positive tumours in a 3 + 3 dose-escalation of intravenous pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) plus 6 mg/kg of intravenous trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the phase 1b study was the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity and recommended phase 2 dose; however, a protocol amendment on Aug 28, 2015, stipulated a flat dose of pembrolizumab of 200 mg every 3 weeks in all Merck-sponsored trials. In phase 2, patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumours were enrolled in parallel cohorts and received the flat dose of pembrolizumab plus standard trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 study was the proportion of PD-L1-positive patients achieving an objective response. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02129556, and with EudraCT, number 2013-004770-10, and is closed. Findings: Between Feb 2, 2015, and April 5, 2017, six patients were enrolled in phase 1b (n=3 received 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab, n=3 received 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab) and 52 patients in phase 2 (n=40 had PD-L1-positive tumours, n=12 had PD-L1-negative tumours). The data cutoff for this analysis was Aug 7, 2017. During phase 1b, there were no dose-limiting toxicities in the dose cohorts tested. Median follow-up for the phase 2 cohort was 13·6 months (IQR 11·6–18·4) for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, and 12·2 months (7·9–12·2) for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours. Six (15%, 90% CI 7–29) of 40 PD-L1-positive patients achieved an objective response. There were no objective responders among the PD-L1-negative patients. The most common treatment-related adverse event of any grade was fatigue (12 [21%] of 58 patients). Grade 3–5 adverse events occurred in 29 (50%) of patients, treatment-related grade 3–5 adverse events occurred in 17 (29%), and serious adverse events occurred in 29 (50%) patients. The most commonly occurring serious adverse events were dyspnoea (n=3 [5%]), pneumonitis (n=3 [5%]), pericardial effusion (n=2 [3%]), and upper respiratory infection (n=2 [3%]). There was one treatment-related death due to Lambert-Eaton syndrome in a PD-L1-negative patient during phase 2. Interpretation: Pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab was safe and showed activity and durable clinical benefit in patients with PD-L1-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, advanced, HER2-positive breast cancer. Further studies in this breast cancer subtype should focus on a PD-L1-positive population and be done in less heavily pretreated patients.

SOX10 expression has been reported in primary triple-negative breast cancer but is poorly studied in metastatic lesions. In this study, the diagnostic utility of a panel of SOX10, GATA3, and androgen receptor (AR) in MBC negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was evaluated and compared with the expression of these markers in the matched primary breast cancer. In a series of 57 triple-negative MBCs, 82% were positive for GATA3, 58% for SOX10, and 25% for AR. Nearly all MBCs (95%) were positive for either GATA3 or SOX10, with 46% dual positive and 5% of cases negative for both markers. Most GATA3-negative MBC cases were SOX10 positive (70%). AR expression was only seen in GATA3-positive MBC (25%) and was significantly more frequent in SOX10-negative MBC (48%) versus SOX10-positive MBC (9%; P = .001). Concordance for GATA3, SOX10, and AR between the primary and metastasis was 89%, 88%, and 80%, respectively. Although GATA3 is a more sensitive lineage marker than SOX10 in MBC, SOX10 is a useful adjunct because it is positive in most GATA3-negative breast metastases. Using both GATA3 and SOX10 is recommended for confirming breast as the site of origin in metastases that lack estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression, whereas the addition of AR is not helpful. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061733905

Despite ET recommendations of 5 to 10 years of treatment, to the authors’ knowledge there is little prospective study of its impact on cognitive function over an extended period of time. ET has known pharmacologic effects on the brain. Cognitive side effects are a concern for many women, with mixed findings reported in various studies. The current prospective longitudinal study examined the neuropsychological effects of ET over time, up to 6 years after treatment. Methods: A total of 189 survivors of early-stage breast cancer enrolled in the study prior to initiating ET if prescribed, and were followed at 6 months (175 patients), 12 months (173 patients), and for 3 to 6 years (102 patients) with self-report and neuropsychological assessments. Using linear mixed models, the authors examined whether neuropsychological performance or impairment rates differed over time based on whether or not ET was received. Results: The authors did not find any effect of ET on neuropsychological performance or impairment at any time point among survivors who received it compared with women who did not. However, those who participated in the 3-year to 6-year year visit demonstrated better executive function at baseline.

Methods: Eligible women were postmenopausal, had hormone receptor positive, stage I-IIIA breast cancer, completed surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and on adjuvant endocrine therapy. At a routine follow-up visit, women (N = 107) completed standardized symptom measures: Brief Fatigue Inventory, Brief Pain Inventory, Menopause Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Neurotoxicity scales. Two performance measures assessed function: grip strength (Jamar dynamometer; n = 71) and timed get-up-and-go (TUG; n = 103). Analyses were performed with an overall symptom composite score. Correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to test adverse effects on physical function. Results: The mean age was 64 years (range 45–84), 81% white, 84% on an aromatase inhibitor, and on endocrine therapy for mean 35 months (range 1–130 months). Dominant hand grip strength was inversely correlated with symptom composite scores (r = −0.29, p =.02).

This study of a large, contemporary US database described national practice patterns and addressed the impact of PMRT on survival for patients with node-negative TNBC. Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried (2004–2014) for women with non-metastatic TNBC with pT1-4N0M0 disease undergoing mastectomy. Use of PMRT was assessed. Multivariable logistic regression ascertained factors associated with PMRT use. The Kaplan–Meier analysis evaluated overall survival (OS) between patients managed with either PMRT or observation following mastectomy when stratifying by pT stage. Cox proportional hazards modeling determined variables associated with OS. Results: A total of 14,464 patients met the selection criteria; of these, 1,569 (10.8%) received PMRT, whereas 12,895 (89.2%) did not receive PMRT. Use of PMRT varied significantly with pT stage, with only 5.7% of T1 patients undergoing PMRT, while 51.6% of patients with T3 disease underwent PMRT. Use of PMRT was associated with superior OS for patients with pT3 disease but not for patients with other T stages. Greater age was associated with decreased likelihood of PMRT use, while increased T stage and positive surgical margins were associated with use of PMRT. On multivariate analysis, increased age, T stage, and positive surgical margins were associated with worse OS. Conclusions: In the largest study to date evaluating the use of PMRT in patients with node-negative TNBC, the use of PMRT was low in patients with T1 and T2 disease. Additionally, while an OS benefit was observed with the use of PMRT in patients with T3 disease, there was no benefit with the use of PMRT in other T stage groups. Further prospective studies are recommended to further elucidate the benefit on PMRT in patients with node-negative TNBC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058692866

Chronic exposure to arsenic through foods and contaminated water has been linked to an increased incidence of several tumors and long-term health complications. Preclinical and population studies have indicated that arsenic exposure may interfere with endocrine regulation and increase the risk of breast tumorigenesis. In this study, we examined the effects of sodium arsenite (NaAsIII) exposure in ERα-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in mammary tumor xenografts. The results revealed that acute (within 4 days) and long-term (10 days to 7 weeks) in vitro exposure to environmentally relevant doses reduced breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and ERα expression associated with the gain of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and folate receptor 1 (FOLR1), and the loss of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) expression. Furthermore, long-term exposure to NaAsIIIinduced the proliferation and compromised the response of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (TAM). The in vitro exposure to NaAsIII induced BRCA1 CpG methylation associated with the increased recruitment of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and the loss of RNA polymerase II (PolII) at the BRCA1 gene. Xenografts of NaAsIII-preconditioned MCF7 cells (MCF7NaAsIII) into the mammary fat pads of nude mice produced a larger tumor volume compared to tumors from control MCF7 cells and were more refractory to TAM in association with the reduced expression of BRCA1 and ERα, CpG hypermethylation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and BRCA1, and the increased expression of FOLR1. These cumulative data support the hypothesis that exposure to AsIII may contribute to reducing the efficacy of endocrine therapy against ERα-positive breast tumors by hampering the expression of ERα and BRCA1 via CpG methylation, respectively of ESR1 and BRCA1. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Units of analysis were contrasts: two-group trials gave rise to one contrast, whereas trials with more than two groups gave rise to more than one contrast. We excluded trials enrolling patients with recurrent, metastatic, or non-invasive disease, and those testing neoadjuvant therapy exclusively. Our primary objective was to estimate patient-level and trial-level correlations between disease-free survival and overall survival. We measured the association between disease-free survival and overall survival using Spearman's correlation coefficient (r s ), and the association between hazard ratios (HRs) for disease-free survival and overall survival using R 2 . We computed the surrogate threshold effect, the maximum HR for disease-free survival that statistically predicts an HR for overall survival less than 1·00 in a future trial. Findings: Eight trials (n=21 480 patients) gave rise to a full set (12 contrasts). Patient-level associations between disease-free and overall survival were strong (r s =0·90 [95% CI 0·89–0·90]). Trial-level associations gave rise to values of R 2 of 0·75 (95% CI 0·50–1·00) for the full set. Subgroups defined by nodal status and hormone receptor status yielded qualitatively similar results. Depending on the expected number of deaths in a future trial, the surrogate threshold effects ranged from 0·56 to 0·81, based on the full set. Interpretation: These findings suggest that it is appropriate to continue to use disease-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival in trials in HER-2-positive, early breast cancer. The key limitation of this study is the dependence of its results on the trials included and on the existence of an outlying trial.

Objective The aim of this study was to test the psychometric performance of the Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Arabic (CBI-BA), including participant understanding of items, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Arabic (FACT-BA). Methods Using a cross-sectional design, 438 cancer patients completed the CBI-BA, 30 of whom completed cognitive interviews. A subsample 167 women with breast cancer also completed the FACT-BA. Internal consistency evidence was assessed with Cronbach's and construct validity with principal axis factoring. Results Internal consistency estimates were acceptable for the total CBI-BA (=.81) and FACT-BA (=.88) scales. Exploratory factor analyses showed evidence of construct validity for the CBI-BA; 1 factor was derived, compared with four in the original English version. Cognitive interviews indicated satisfactory patient understanding of CBI-BA items. The Arabic version of the general FACT-General scale had 4 factors according to expectation. Conclusion The CBI-BA has adequate psychometric performance for the measurement of self-efficacy for coping with cancer in Arabic patients. The FACT-General Arabic has adequate evidence of reliability and validity for the measurement of quality of life in Arabic women with breast cancer. Implications for Practice The availability of culturally sensitive and psychometrically sound instruments for Arabic patients diagnosed with cancer should be valuable for healthcare clinicians and researchers to assess self-efficacy for coping with cancer and quality of life. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062106569

The Self-Regulation Model of FCR (Lee-Jones C, Humphris G, Dixon R, Hatcher MB. Fear of cancer recurrence-a literature review and proposed cognitive formulation to explain exacerbation of recurrence fears. Psychooncology. 1997;6:95-105.) states that everyday cancer-related events trigger FCR, which, in turn, leads to specific behavioral responses, including checking the body for signs or symptoms of cancer. Links between triggering events, FCR, and checking behavior have not yet been studied in the context of daily life or at the within-person level. Purpose: The goal of this study was to examine whether FCR has a within-person link with daily checking behavior and whether FCR mediates the link between triggering events and checking behavior. Methods: Seventy-two early-stage BC survivors completed daily diaries over a 21-day period approximately 5 months after BC surgery. FCR, checking behavior, and triggering events were assessed each evening. Results: Multilevel modeling results indicated that FCR predicted greater odds of same-day, but not next-day, checking behavior. We found that daily FCR significantly mediated the same-day effect of triggering events on checking behavior. These average within-person effects varied substantially between patients and were not explained by momentary negative affect. Conclusions: Findings support the within-person relationship between triggering events, FCR, and checking behavior posited by guiding theory, and can inform FCR intervention development. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2018.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054414048

Automated methods developed for the first three of these facets identify entities, but outcome detection has been limited to identifying the entire sentence. We frame outcome detection as a noun phrase prediction task and use semi-supervised learning to detect new outcomes (aka endpoints) from the method section of 88 K MEDLINE abstracts. A manual analysis showed that 96.7% of all outcomes can be captured using a noun phrase representation. With respect to the machine learning classifiers, the Support Vector Machine produced higher precision, F1-score, and accuracy than the General Linear Model when evaluated with respect to the initial gold standard of survivorship seed terms and a manual gold standard that considered all outcomes. However, the best model does not employ machine learning, but rather leverages list structure and resulted in 90.14 precision, 60.69 recall, 75.41 F1-score, and 92.60 accuracy with respect to the manual gold standard of all outcomes. Finally we developed a silver standard with a precision of 89.28 and recall of 86.77 compared to the manual gold standard and used the silver standard to identify all outcomes reported for five breast cancer treatments. The increased precision afforded by this approach reveals that in contrast to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, the surrogate outcome disease free survival (DFS) is reported more frequently than the clinically relevant outcome overall survival (OS) for hormone therapies, which is consistent with findings that DFS translates into firm OS improvements in a hormone therapy setting. © 2019","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062478674

The aims of this study were to (1) identify and weigh the risk factors for persistent lymphedema (PLE) among all patients with BCRL and (2) establish a prediction model for the occurrence of PLE. Methods: A cohort of 342 patients with BCRL with a median follow-up of 5 years after the onset of swelling was analyzed. PLE was defined as a hardening of the subcutaneous tissue, the persistence of the circumferential difference (CD) between arms, or a flare-up of swelling during follow-up. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for PLE, including tumors, treatments, and patient-related factors. The prediction accuracy of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Of the 342 patients with BCRL, 229 (67%) had PLE. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of lymph node metastases (p = 0.012), the maximal CD between arms at the first occurrence of swelling (p < 0.001), and the largest difference during follow-up (p < 0.001) were significant predictors for PLE. The corresponding AUC was 0.908. Although inclusion of body weight gains (p = 0.008) and maximal CD at the latest follow-up (p = 0.002) increased the analytical accuracy (AUC = 0.920), the resulting AUC values (p = 0.113) were not significantly different. Conclusions: BCRL is persistent in two thirds of patients. Patients with more lymph node metastases, weight gain, and larger CD since the onset of swelling and during follow-up have an increased likelihood of developing PLE. © 2018, The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85051683294

We aimed to calculate and compare RT TBVs between two cohorts managed with and without the device. Methods and Materials: Data from patients with breast cancer who were treated at Rhode Island Hosptial, Providence RI between May 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and grouped based on 3-dimensional bioabsorbable marker placement. Pathology reports were used to calculate tumor excision volume (TEV) after breast conservation. Specifically, the three dimensions provided were multiplied to generate a cubic volume, defined as TEV. TBV was calculated using treatment volumes generated with Philips Pinnacle3 treatment planning software (Andover, MA). Linear regression analyses assessed the relationship between excised TEV and TBV. T tests compared the slopes of the best fit lines for plots of TEV versus TBV. Results: In this retrospective case-control study, 116 patients undergoing breast RT were identified; of whom 42 received a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable marker and 74 did not. The mean TEVs were 102.7 cm 3 with the device and 103.2 cm 3 without the device, and the mean TBVs for the same groups were 27.5 cm 3 and 40.1 cm 3 , respectively. The TBV standard errors for patients who did and did not receive 3-dimensional bioabsorbable markers were 23.739 and 38.685, respectively. The t tests found the slopes of the lines of best fit for these cohorts to be statistically significantly different (P =.001), with smaller TBVs achieved with 3-dimensional bioabsorbable marker placement. Conclusions: When comparing TBVs between patients contemporaneously treated with or without a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable marker, device placement was associated with statistically significantly smaller TBVs in the setting of similar TEVs. © 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology","Final",,2-s2.0-85056462014

However, the association between these two entities has not been studied in detail. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and histopathological factors associated to recurrence of IDC with those of DCIS-associated IDC (IDC + DCIS). Materials and methods: A prospective observational longitudinal study of 464 patients was performed between 2010 and 2015. Patients with IDC and DCIS + IDC were included and analyzed. Results: IDC + DCIS was present in 243 patients (52.4%). No difference on histopathological characteristics were found, only Grade I and II of invasive component were more frequent in patients with IDC + DCIS than those with IDC (p = 0.038). No differences on recurrence were found between the main groups (p = 0.256). For patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those with IDC + DCIS had lower response than those with IDC alone (p = 0.014). No differences between the main groups were found on recurrence (p = 0.256). For patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, recurrence was present in 19 patients (30.6%) in the IDC group in contrast to 5 (12.2%) in the IDC + DCIS group (p = 0.030). Mortality was present in 15 patients (24.2%) in the IDC group in contrast to 3 (7.3%) in the IDC + DCIS group (p = 0.027). At 7 years, 80.8% patients were alive: 71.9% from the IDC group and 92.7% from the IDC + DCIS group. Conclusions: The presence of DCIS seems to be indicative of a benign behavior in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Longer DFS and higher overall survival were found in the IDC + DCIS group despite presenting with a lower response to chemotherapy.

This study aimed to determine whether a 3-week schedule of postmastectomy hypofractionated radiotherapy is as efficacious and safe as a 5-week schedule of conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Methods: This randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 study was done in a single academic hospital in China. Patients aged 18–75 years who had undergone mastectomy and had at least four positive axillary lymph nodes or primary tumour stage T3–4 disease were eligible to participate. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a computer-generated central randomisation schedule, without stratification, to receive chest wall and nodal irradiation at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (conventional fractionated radiotherapy) or 43·5 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks (hypofractionated radiotherapy). The modified intention-to-treat population (including all eligible patients who underwent randomisation but excluding those who were considered ineligible or withdrew consent after randomisation) was used in primary and safety analyses. The primary endpoint was 5-year locoregional recurrence, and a 5% margin was used to establish non-inferiority (equivalent to a hazard ratio <1·883). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00793962. Findings: Between June 12, 2008, and June 16, 2016, 820 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the conventional fractionated radiotherapy group (n=414) or hypofractionated radiotherapy group (n=406). 409 participants in the conventional fractionated radiotherapy group and 401 participants in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. At a median follow-up of 58·5 months (IQR 39·2–81·8), 60 (7%) patients had developed locoregional recurrence (31 patients in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group and 29 in the conventional fractionated radiotherapy group); the 5-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence was 8·3% (90% CI 5·8–10·7) in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group and 8·1% (90% CI 5·4–10·6) in the conventional fractionated radiotherapy group (absolute difference 0·2%, 90% CI −3·0 to 2·6; hazard ratio 1·10, 90% CI 0·72 to 1·69; p<0·0001 for non-inferiority). There were no significant differences between the groups in acute and late toxicities, except that fewer patients in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group had grade 3 acute skin toxicity than in the conventional fractionated radiotherapy group (14 [3%] of 401 patients vs 32 [8%] of 409 patients; p<0·0001). Interpretation: Postmastectomy hypofractionated radiotherapy was non-inferior to and had similar toxicities to conventional fractionated radiotherapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer. Hypofractionated radiotherapy could provide more convenient treatment and allow providers to treat more patients.

Several studies have reported dosimetry comparison and tolerable acute toxicity profile with limited follow-up. We report our institutional experience of postmastectomy proton radiation including clinical efficacy and toxicities. Methods: From December 2013 to February 2015, 42 consecutive patients who received mastectomy for non-metastatic breast cancer were treated with adjuvant chest wall and regional nodal proton therapy at a single proton center. 3D conformal uniform scanning with en face matching fields was used. Results: The median follow-up among patients was 35 months (range 1–55 months). There was one local failure, zero regional nodal failure, and six distant failures. The 3-year rate of locoregional disease-free survival was 96.3%, metastasis-free survival was 84.1%, and overall survival was 97.2%. The only local failure event occurred on the chest wall within the radiation field, approximately 2.5 years after the completion of radiation. Skin dermatitis, fatigue, and esophagitis were the most common acute toxicity. All patients developed grade 1 or 2 acute skin toxicity and there was no grade 3 or 4 acute skin toxicity. Proton radiation is able to achieve excellent target coverage with median PTV V95 over 95% and heart sparing with median mean heart dose less than 1 Gy (RBE). Conclusion: With close to three years of median follow-up, post-mastectomy proton radiation has shown excellent locoregional control rates and favorable toxicity profile. Long-term adverse effect of heart-sparing radiation will require longer follow-up time and randomized clinical trials. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056001842

Fatigue was the variable most consistently associated with patient-reported physical functioning and age and comorbidities were the variables most consistently associated with objectively measured physical functioning. Conclusion: Older BCS should be screened for functional limitations using simple standardized objective tests and interventions that focus on improving strength and reducing fatigue should be tested. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055021054

Matched controls had contemporaneous low-deductible enrollment. Low-income women in HDHPs experienced relative delays of 1.6 months to first breast imaging, 2.7 months to first biopsy, 6.6 months to incident early-stage breast cancer diagnosis, and 8.7 months to first chemotherapy. High-income HDHP members had shorter delays that did not differ significantly from those of their low-income counterparts. HDHP members living in metropolitan, nonmetropolitan, predominantly white, and predominantly nonwhite areas also experienced delayed breast cancer care.

We analyzed RNA-seq data of 348 primary breast cancers and developed a method to identify circRNAs that does not rely on unmapped reads or known splice junctions. We identified 95,843 circRNAs, of which 20,441 were found recurrently. Of the circRNAs that match exon boundaries of the same gene, 668 showed a poor or even negative (R <0.2) correlation with the expression level of the linear gene. In silico analysis showed only a minority (8.5%) of circRNAs could be explained by known splicing events. Both these observations suggest that specific regulatory processes for circRNAs exist. We confirmed the presence of circRNAs of CNOT2, CREBBP, and RERE in an independent pool of primary breast cancers. We identified circRNA profiles associated with subgroups of breast cancers and with biological and clinical features, such as amount of tumor lymphocytic infiltrate and proliferation index. siRNA-mediated knockdown of circCNOT2 was shown to significantly reduce viability of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-474, further underlining the biological relevance of circRNAs. Furthermore, we found that circular, and not linear, CNOT2 levels are predictive for progression-free survival time to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in advanced breast cancer patients, and found that circCNOT2 is detectable in cell-free RNA from plasma. We showed that circRNAs are abundantly present, show characteristics of being specifically regulated, are associated with clinical and biological properties, and thus are relevant in breast cancer. © 2019 Smid et al.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062091770

Study Aims: Compare the cognitive effort employed by BCS to healthy controls (HC) during neuropsychological tests (NPT) for memory, sustained attention, verbal fluency, visuospatial ability, processing speed and executive function; and Investigate the relationship between PR-indexed cognitive effort and participants’ self-report of cognitive function. Methods: Self-report of cognitive function was collected from 23 BCS and 23 HC. PR was measured during NPT. Independent two-sample t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare group scores. Between-group effect size (Cohen’s d) was calculated for each outcome. Correlation between mean self-report scores and PR values, as well as 95% confidence intervals, was calculated. Results: No group differences were demonstrated for NPT performance. BCS reported more issues with cognitive function than HC (p <.0001). A group effect for BCS was seen with PR-indexed cognitive effort for components of most NPT (p <.05). PR was correlated with most self-report measures of cognitive function (r = 0.33–0.45). Conclusions: PR sensitivity to cognitive effort across a variety of NPT and correlation with self-report of cognitive function was demonstrated. The portability, affordability, and “real-time” aspects of PR are attractive for potential use in the clinic setting to assess cognitive function. A larger study is needed to confirm these results. Prospective investigation of PR in BCS is needed to demonstrate sensitivity to cognitive function changes over time. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85051288341

This study demonstrates a protective effect of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)-p21CIP1 axis in bCSC inhibition by BITC. Exposure of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SUM159) to plasma-achievable concentrations of BITC resulted in a robust induction of KLF4 mRNA and its protein expression as determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting or confocal microscopy. BITC-mediated suppression of bCSC markers, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity and mammosphere frequency, was significantly augmented by transient or stable knockdown of KLF4. Western blotting and IHC revealed relatively higher levels of KLF4 protein in mammary tumor sections from BITC-treated mice in comparison with controls, but the difference was insignificant. Analysis of the breast cancer RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicated significant positive correlation between expression of KLF4 and that of p21CIP1 (CDKN1A) but not β-Catenin (CTNNB1). Knockdown of p21CIP1 protein also amplified BITC-mediated suppression of bCSC. Finally, KLF4 was recruited to the promoter of p21CIP1 as indicated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. These results indicate that induction of KLF4-p21CIP1 axis attenuates inhibitory effect of BITC on bCSC self-renewal. Translational implication of these findings is that breast cancer chemoprevention by BITC may be augmented with a combination regimen involving BITC and an inhibitor of KLF4. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062387589

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to identify prototypical presystemic therapy psychoneurological symptom clusters among older breast cancer survivors and determine whether these symptom clusters predicted cognition and QOL over time. Methods: Women with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer (n = 319) and matched noncancer controls (n = 347) aged 60+ years completed questionnaires and neuropsychological tests before systemic therapy and 12 and 24 months later. Latent class analysis identified clusters of survivors based on their pretherapy depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and pain. Linear mixed-effects models examined changes in objective cognition, perceived cognition, and functional status (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living disability, functional well-being, and breast cancer–specific QOL) by group, controlling for covariates. Results: Nearly one-fifth of older survivors were classified as having high pretherapy symptoms (n = 51; 16%); the remainder had low symptoms (n = 268; 84%); both groups improved over time on all outcomes. However, compared to the low symptom group and controls, survivors with high symptoms had lower baseline objective cognition and lower perceived cognition at baseline and 24 months, lower functional well-being at baseline and 12 months, greater Instrumental Activities of Daily Living disability at baseline, and lower breast cancer–specific QOL at all time points (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Nearly one-fifth of older breast cancer survivors had high psychoneurological symptoms at diagnosis, which predicted clinically meaningful decrements in perceived cognition and function in the first 24 months after diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis of TNBC metastases and primary cancers from other organs can be difficult due to lack of a TNBC standard immunoprofile. We analyzed the diagnostic value of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), Napsin A, mammaglobin, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15), Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10 (SOX10), GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), and androgen receptor in a series of 207 TNBC and 152 primary lung adenocarcinomas (LA). All tested TNBCs were TTF1 and Napsin A-negative. When comparing TNBC and TTF1-positive or negative LA, SOX10 had the best sensitivity (62.3%) and specificity (100%) as a marker in favor of TNBC compared with LA, irrespective of TTF1 status (P<0.0001). GATA3 had moderate sensitivity (30.4%) and excellent specificity (98.7%) and misclassified only 2/152 LA (1.3%). GCDFP15 had a moderate sensitivity (20.8%) and excellent specificity (98%) and misclassified only 3/152 (2%) LA. Mammaglobin and androgen receptor had moderate sensitivities (38.2% and 30%), good specificities (81.6% and 86%), and misclassified 28/152 and 21/152 LAs, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the best markers, enabling the distinction between SOX10-negative TNBC and TTF1 and Napsin A-negative LA were GATA3 (odds ratio=33.5; 95% confidence interval, 7.3-153.5; P<0.0001) and GCDFP15 (odds ratio=31.7; 95% confidence interval, 6.9-145.6; P<0.0001). Only 13/207 (6.3%) TNBC cases did not express any aforementioned marker. On the basis of our results, the best sequential immunohistochemical analysis to differentiate TNBC from TTF1-negative LA is first SOX10 followed by GATA3, and finally GCDFP15.

Additionally, we assessed hotspot TIL count consistency by comparing hotspot counts in 3 separate locations within a single whole-tissue section. Anti-CD8 immunohistochemistry was performed on a representative section from 66 cases of primary TNBC, which were then scanned as whole-slide images. Quantification of the tissue area and combined stromal and intratumoral CD8+ TILs was performed using digital image analysis (DIA) within 2.2 mm–diameter circle hotspots. TIL counts were quantified as absolute counts and densities (absolute count/tissue area in micrometers 2 ). For each case, 6 pathologists placed a single hotspot, defined as an area with the subjectively highest CD8+ immunoreactivity, within the tumor bed. Separately for each case, a single pathologist placed hotspots in 3 different locations within a single tumor section. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were generated following TIL enumeration via DIA. ICCs for single hotspot placement by 6 pathologists were 0.96 for density and 0.97 for absolute counts, respectively. In 32% of cases (21/66), all the hotspots placed by the 6 pathologists were in the same location. When evaluating hotspots in 3 different locations within a tumor, the ICC was 0.95 for both density and absolute counts.

Objective: Given the introduction of national initiatives to improve management of psychiatric symptoms among patients with cancer, we examined patterns of depression detection and treatment over time, and with respect to patient characteristics. Methods: This cross-sectional study linked data from the Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2005 and 2013, with data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California's electronic medical record. Pathways participants eligible for this analysis had no known prior depression but reported depressive symptoms at baseline. We used modified Poisson regression to assess the association of cancer diagnosis year and other patient characteristics with receipt of a documented clinician response to depressive symptoms (depression diagnosis, mental health referral, or antidepressant prescription). Results: Of the 725 women in our sample, 34% received a clinician response to depression. We observed no statistically significant association of breast cancer diagnosis year with clinician response. Characteristics associated with clinician response included Asian race (adjusted risk ratio, Asian vs. white: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29–0.68) and depression severity (adjusted risk ratio, mild-moderate vs. severe depression: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.11–1.88). Conclusion: Most patients in our sample did not receive a clinician response to their study-reported depression, and rates of response do not appear to have improved over time.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of the primary tumor remains controversial among women with stage IV breast cancer. METHODS: Women diagnosed with clinical stage IV breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database. Those with intact primary tumors who were alive 12 months after diagnosis were categorized by treatment sequence: (1) surgery before systemic therapy, (2) systemic therapy before surgery, and (3) systemic therapy alone. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the association of treatment sequence with surgery type. Overall survival was estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Among 24,015 women, 56.2% (13,505) underwent systemic therapy alone and 43.8% (10,510) underwent surgical resection. Rates of surgery decreased slightly over time (43.1% in 2003 to 41.9% in 2011). Treatment with systemic therapy before surgery was associated with larger tumor size (median 4.5 vs 3.1 cm, P < 0.001) and receipt of mastectomy (81.4% vs 52.2%, P < 0.001) when compared to those who underwent surgery first. Receipt of surgery, whether before or after systemic therapy (Hazard Ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.73; Hazard Ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.61; P < 0.001), was independently associated with improved adjusted overall survival when compared to systemic therapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of the primary tumor occurs in almost half of women with stage IV breast cancer alive 1 year after diagnosis, and is increasingly occurring after systemic therapy.

The objective of this study was to describe individual-level reasons for attending or not attending ‘two cancers’ screening using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The study sample was from the Health Services Survey in 2013 in Jiangsu, China. A total of 6520 rural women aged 36–65 years answered the questions on ‘two cancers’ screening participation and were included in the final analysis, which consisted of univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: In the results of multivariate logistic regression, factors significantly associated with having ‘two cancers’ screening included educational level (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65–0.92), per capita household income (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.58–0.73), availability of female medical faculty in township facilities (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.28–0.42), quality of life (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.58–0.90), being nulliparous (OR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.96–5.26), and multiparous (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.68–2.16). Conclusion: To reduce inadequate screening service utilization of breast and cervical cancer in rural areas, efforts should be made not only to target the vulnerable rural women with lower income, lower educational level, and lower health conditions but also to further improve access to female primary-care providers. Strategies are also urgently needed to focus on nulliparous and multiparous women. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","Final",,2-s2.0-85060640949

In this paper, using data from six randomized trials for first- or second-line advanced breast cancer (ABC) treatments with various mechanisms of action, tumor size change from baseline at different observation time points was evaluated as a predictor for survival endpoints using different modeling approaches. The aim is to establish a predictive model where tumor size change from baseline can be used as a treatment independent predictive marker for PFS and OS in first- and second-line ABC. The results showed that tumor size change at single time point (TSP) or up to certain time points as a time-varying covariate (TSTVC) were significant predictors for OS and PFS in the survival models along with other covariates identified for each line of treatment. TSP and TSTVC models performed similarly for first-line treatments; TSTVC performed significantly better for second-line treatments. Eight weeks was selected as the recommended early evaluation time of tumor size change to predict OS and PFS in both first- and second-line treatment, while better prediction can be achieved for first-line OS by using 16 weeks tumor size change.

In this study, we hypothesized that sulforaphane, a dietary component abundant in broccoli and its sprouts, can inhibit malignant cell proliferation and tumor sphere formation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) in TNBC. CSC population was isolated using FACS analysis with the combined stem cell surface markers, CD44+/CD24-/CD49f+ The effect of sulforaphane on a stem-related embryonic oncogene CRIPTO-1/TDGF1 (CR1) was evaluated via ELISA. In vivo, BalbC/nude mice were supplemented with sulforaphane before and after TNBC cell inoculation (daily intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg sulforaphane/kg for 5 and 3 weeks, respectively), and the effects of sulforaphane during mammary tumor initiation and growth were accessed with NanoString gene analysis. We found that sulforaphane can inhibit cell proliferation and mammosphere formation of CSCs in TNBC. Further analysis of gene expression in these TNBC tumor cells revealed that sulforaphane significantly decreases the expression of cancer-specific CR1, CRIPTO-3/TDGF1P3 (CR3, a homologue of CR1), and various stem cell markers including Nanog, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), Wnt3, and Notch4. Our results suggest that sulforaphane may control the malignant proliferation of CSCs in TNBC via Cripto-mediated pathway by either suppressing its expression and/or by inhibiting Cripto/Alk4 protein complex formation.

Here, we define WNT10B-dependent biomarkers for b-CATENIN/HMGA2/EZH2 signaling predictive of reduced relapse-free survival. Concordant expression of HMGA2 and EZH2 proteins is observed in MMTV-Wnt10b LacZ transgenic mice during metastasis, and Hmga2 haploin-sufficiency decreased EZH2 protein expression, repressing lung metastasis. A novel autoregulatory loop interdependent on HMGA2 and EZH2 expression is essential for b-CATENIN/TCF-4/LEF-1 transcription. Mechanistically, both HMGA2 and EZH2 displaced Groucho/TLE1 from TCF-4 and served as gatekeepers for K49 acetylation on b-CATENIN, which is essential for transcription. In addition, we discovered that HMGA2-EZH2 interacts with the PRC2 complex. Absence of HMGA2 or EZH2 expression or chemical inhibition of Wnt signaling in a chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of TNBC abolished visceral metastasis, repressing AXIN2, MYC, EZH2, and HMGA2 expression in vivo. Combinatorial therapy of a WNT inhibitor with doxorubicin synergisti-cally activated apoptosis in vitro, resensitized PDX-derived cells to doxorubicin, and repressed lung metastasis in vivo.

Breast cancer intratumoral heterogeneity is incompletely studied. Comprehensive biomarker analysis of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and Ki67 labeling index was performed on each tissue block of 100 entirely submitted breast tumors in 99 patients. Invasive carcinoma and in situ carcinoma was scored using semiquantitative histologic score (H-score) for ER and PR, HER2 expression from 0 to 3+, and percentage positive cells for Ki67. Core biopsy results were compared with surgical excision results, invasive carcinoma was compared with in situ carcinoma, and interblock tumoral heterogeneity was assessed using measures of dispersion (coefficient of variation and quartile coefficient of dispersion). Overall concordance between core biopsy and surgical excision was 99% for ER and 95% for PR. Mean histologic score of ER was significantly lower in invasive carcinoma between core biopsy and surgical excision (p = 0.000796). Intratumoral heterogeneity was higher for PR than for ER (mean coefficient of variation for ER 0.08 stdv 0.13 vs. PR 0.26 stdv 0.41). Ki67 labeling index was significantly higher in invasive carcinoma as compared with associated ductal carcinoma in situ on surgical resection specimen (p ≤ 0.0001). Ki67 hotspots were identified in 47% of cases. Of 52 HER2 negative cases on core biopsy, 10 were scored as equivocal on surgical resection. None (0/10) were amplified by Her-2/neu fluorescence in situ hybridization. Overall, biomarkers on core biopsy showed concordance with the surgical excision specimen in the vast majority of cases. Biomarker expression of in situ closely approximates associated invasive carcinoma. Intratumoral heterogeneity of PR is greater than ER. Biomarker expression on diagnostic core biopsy or single tumor block is representative of breast carcinoma as a whole in most cases and is appropriate for clinical decision-making. © 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055116715

Materials and Methods: An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39–89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act–qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results: On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87).

The purpose of this study was to characterize the concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of L-lactate transport and the membrane permeability properties of AR-C155858 and AZD3965 in the murine 4T1 breast tumor cells that express MCT1. Our results demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of L-lactate uptake by AR-C155858 and AZD3965 with maximal inhibition occurring after a 5-min pre-incubation period and prolonged inhibition. Following removal of AR-C155858 or AZD3965 from the incubation buffer, inhibition of L-lactate uptake was only fully reversed after 3 and 12 h, respectively, indicating that these inhibitors are slowly reversible. The uptake of AR-C155858 was concentration-dependent in 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of AZD3965 exhibited no concentration dependence over the range of concentrations examined. The uptake kinetics of AR-C155858 was best fitted to a Michaelis-Menten equation with a diffusional clearance component, P (K m  = 0.399 ± 0.067 μM, V max  = 4.79 ± 0.58 pmol/mg/min, and P = 0.330 ± 0.088 μL/mg/min).

We investigated the proportion of gross duplications occurring in tandem in breast cancer predisposition genes with the intent of informing their classifications. Methods: The DNA breakpoint assay (DBA) is a custom, paired-end, next-generation sequencing (NGS) method designed to capture and detect deep-intronic DNA breakpoints in gross duplications in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDH1, PALB2, and CHEK2. Results: DBA allowed us to ascertain breakpoints for 44 unique gross duplications from 147 probands. We determined that the duplications occurred in tandem in 114 (78%) carriers from this cohort, while the remainder have unknown tandem status. Among the tandem gross duplications that were eligible for reclassification, 95% of them were upgraded to pathogenic. Conclusion: DBA is a novel, high-throughput, NGS-based method that informs the tandem status, and thereby the classification of, gross duplications.

Ultrasound evaluation of our first case demonstrated hypo-echoic thickened anterior strap muscles while in the second case there was significant distortion of the anatomy from previous surgeries. It was necessary to proceed with FNA biopsy even when their ultrasound findings were equivocal, to establish a definite rapid diagnosis. The immediate onsite evaluation findings were suggestive of malignancy in both cases with subsequent core biopsy confirming the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma. In cytopathology, point-of-care (POC) ultrasound is used as an adjunct tool that offers visual guidance during FNA of nonpalpable masses and enables sampling of lesional “hot” spots to ensure specimen adequacy. Studies have demonstrated a reduction in FNA nondiagnostic rates with the use of ultrasound-guidance consequently reducing health care costs associated with nondiagnostic FNAs.

In the current study, transporter gene knockout mice and Caco-2 cells were used to explore the effects of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) on the disposition of ET-G and 4-ME-G. After oral or i.v. administration of ET and 4-ME, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last data point or infinity values of ET, 4-ME, and their glucuronides (ET-G and 4-ME-G) were remarkably and significantly increased in most Bcrp12/2 and Mrp22/2 mice compared with those in wild-type FVB mice (P < 0.05). These results were accompanied with a significant increase of maximum plasma concentration values (P < 0.05). In Caco-2 monolayers, the efflux and clearance rates of ET-G and 4-ME-G were markedly reduced by the BCRP inhibitor Ko143 and MRP2 inhibitor MK571 on the apical side (P < 0.05). In an intestinal perfusion study, the excretion of ET-G was significantly decreased in perfusate and increased in plasma in Bcrp12/2 mice compared with those in wild-type FVB mice (P < 0.05). The 4-ME-G concentration was also decreased in the bile in transporter gene knockout mice. ET and 4-ME showed good permeability in both Caco-2 monolayers [apparent permeability (Papp) ‡ 0.59 3 1025 cm/s] and duodenum (Papp ‡ 1.81). In conclusion, BCRP and MRP2 are involved in excreting ET-G and 4-ME-G.

Methods: The combined frequency of mutations in 23 BC and/or UC genes was compared between BUC cases and control groups with (1) no personal cancer history; (2) BC only; and (3) UC only using logistic regression. Results: Fourteen percent (n = 231) of BUC cases tested positive for mutations in BC and/or UC genes and were significantly more likely to test positive than individuals with BC only (P < 0.001), UC only (P < 0.01), or unaffected controls (P < 0.001). Analysis of gene-specific mutation frequencies revealed that MSH6, CHEK2, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PMS2, PALB2 and MSH2 were most frequently mutated among BUC cases. Compared to BC only, BRCA1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and PTEN mutations were more frequent among BUC; however, only ATM mutations were more frequent among BUC compared to UC only. All of the more commonly mutated genes have published management guidelines to guide clinical care. Of patients with a single mutation in a gene with established testing criteria (n = 152), only 81.6% met their respective criteria, and 65.8% met criteria for multiple syndromes. Conclusions: Women with BUC are more likely to carry hereditary cancer gene mutations than women with breast or uterine cancer alone, potentially warranting expanded genetic testing for these women. Most mutations found via multi-gene panel testing in women with BUC have accompanying published management guidelines and significant implications for clinical care. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059400620

Theory and Methods: Ultrafast, fast, and high spatial resolution DCE-MRI data were acquired on 15 patients with suspicious breast lesions. Segmentation of the vasculature from the surrounding tissue was performed by applying a Hessian filter to the enhanced image to generate a map of the probability for each voxel to belong to a vessel. Summary measures were generated for vascular morphology, as well as the inputs and outputs of vessels physically connected to the tumor. The ultrafast DCE-MRI data was analyzed by a modified Tofts model to estimate the bolus arrival time, K trans (volume transfer coefficient), and v p (plasma volume fraction). The measures were compared between malignant and benign lesions via the Wilcoxon test, and then incorporated into a logistic ridge regression model to assess their combined diagnostic ability. Results: A total of 24 lesions were included in the study (13 malignant and 11 benign). The vessel count, K trans , and v p showed significant difference between malignant and benign lesions (P = 0.009, 0.034, and 0.010, area under curve [AUC] = 0.76, 0.63, and 0.70, respectively). The best multivariate logistic regression model for differentiation included the vessel count and bolus arrival time (AUC = 0.91).

A profound role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of human cancer is being uncovered, including in cancer therapy. Using in silico prediction algorithms, we identified miR-873 as a potential regulator of KRAS, and we investigated its role in PDAC and TNBC. We found that reduced miR-873 expression is associated with shorter patient survival in both cancers. miR-873 expression is significantly repressed in PDAC and TNBC cell lines and inversely correlated with KRAS levels. We demonstrate that miR-873 directly bound to the 3′ UTR of KRAS mRNA and suppressed its expression. Notably, restoring miR-873 expression induced apoptosis; recapitulated the effects of KRAS inhibition on cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion; and suppressed the activity of ERK and PI3K/AKT, while overexpression of KRAS rescued the effects mediated by miR-873. Moreover, in vivo delivery of miR-873 nanoparticles inhibited KRAS expression and tumor growth in PDAC and TNBC tumor models. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that miR-873 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting KRAS and that miR-873-based gene therapy may be a therapeutic strategy in PDAC and TNBC. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059863937

In this study, we demonstrate that when naive MSCs and malignant breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) were injected into opposing mammary glands of an immunodeficient nude mouse, both cell types formed tumor-like masses within 8 weeks at the injected site. Surprisingly, MDA-MB231 cells were detected in the opposing mammary gland injected with the naive MSCs, indicating migration and crosstalk between naive MSCs and MDA-MB231 cells. Furthermore, when naive MSCs preexposed to MDA-MB231-derived conditioned medium (CM; MSC CM ) or purified exosomes (Exo; MSC Exo ) were injected into mammary glands of nude mice, they too formed a tumor-like mass with stromal tissue within 14 weeks. Interestingly, cells dissociated from these primary explants also formed tumor-like masses. Finally, injecting MSC CM or MSC Exo and naive MSCs into opposing mammary glands formed tumor-like masses on the naive MSC-injected side, suggesting migration and crosstalk between MSC CM or MSC Exo with naive MSCs, similar to that observed between malignant MDA-MB231 cells and naive MSCs. Importantly, molecular analysis of MSC CM and MSC Exo revealed DNA hypermethylation. These data demonstrate that MSCs and breast cancer cells communicate, resulting in the transformation of naive MSCs into cells capable of forming explants in nude mice. Our data also suggest that DNA hypermethylation might have contribute to their migration. Understanding the crosstalk between MSCs and tumor cells, and identifying the players involved in their interaction, will help us develop novel therapeutics for breast cancer regression and elimination. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062417863

Despite the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer registration is still underdeveloped in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is the case in Lagos, Nigeria. Lakeshore Cancer Center (LCC) sought to retrospectively collect and describe the characteristics of the patients seen in its first 2 y of existence. Methods: A retrospective review of patient records presenting at LCC was performed. Various parameters were collected such as demographics and diagnoses. These data were used to perform a simple descriptive analysis. A series of consultations determined what parameters to include in the registry. CanReg, a cancer registration application, was customized to include these parameters. Results: Between July 2014 and June 2016, a total of 226 cancer incidence cases were presented at LCC. There was an increasing number of new cancer cases when evaluated at 6-mo intervals. The most common cancers presented were breast (38%), prostate (12%), and colorectal (8%) cancers. The majority of patients (85%) were presented at later cancer stages. Conclusions: Breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers were the three most common cancer cases seen at LCC. Late-stage presentation remains a challenge. These results reveal the need for early detection and screening methods to help change the stage distribution. The cancer registry will be utilized to collect cancer data and to allow for analysis and better treatment/prevention protocols.

Clinical genetic data from multigene testing can provide insights into the germline pathogenic variant (PV) spectrum and correlates in men with PCA unselected for metastatic disease to optimize identification of men for genetic evaluation and management. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted of de-identified clinical genetic testing data from a large commercial genetic testing laboratory in the US. ICD-10 claims codes were used to identify men with PCA, along with family history data. Gleason score was abstracted from test request forms. Overall PV rate among men with PCA was estimated, along with PVs in DNA repair genes. Family history and Gleason score association to germline DNA repair PVs was assessed using Fisher's exact test with correction for false-discovery. Results: As of August 2017, genetic results were available on 1328 men with PCA. Overall PV rate was 15.6%, with 10.9% of PV in DNA repair genes. PVs were most commonly identified in BRCA2 (4.5%), CHEK2 (2.2%), ATM (1.8%), and BRCA1 (1.1%).

Conclusions: A substantial proportion of men with PCA unselected for metastatic disease carry germline DNA repair PVs.

Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 254 patients had a form of atypia diagnosed on ultrasound, MRI or stereotactic VAB and met eligibility for this study. Demographic, imaging, biopsy and pathology characteristics were analyzed for association with upgrade. We compared isolated FEA to all of the atypias grouped together. Results: Of the 254 atypia lesions, 72 (28%) were isolated FEA, and the upgrade rate was 2.8% (2/72). Statistically significant factors present with upgrade of isolated FEA include personal history of breast cancer and cancer diagnosis on a concurrent separate core biopsy. Other factors associated with upgrade include first degree family history of breast cancer, segmental calcification distribution, extent of calcifications >2 cm, and <25% of calcifications removed on biopsy. Conclusion: In patients with biopsy results of isolated FEA, in the absence of personal or first degree family history of breast cancer, cancer on a concurrent biopsy, segmental calcification distribution, extent of calcifications >2 cm, and only 0–24% calcifications removed on biopsy, patients may be safely followed with imaging, avoiding unnecessary excision. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057287442

We evaluated the characteristics of prior cancer exclusion criteria in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) trials and determined its prognostic effect on patients with NPC. Methods: We reviewed NPC trials for prior cancer exclusion criteria. Then we estimated the effect of prior cancer among NPC patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Propensity score-matching was used to compensate for differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without prior cancer. Results: There were 109 clinical trials involving 10,437 patients; 49 trials (45%) excluded patients with prior cancer. Prior cancer exclusion was more common in recent or phase III trials. We identified 10,195 NPC patients; 6.2% had prior cancer. More than 70% of these cancers were in situ/localized/regional and diagnosed relatively close to the NPC diagnosis (median 3.3 years). Patients with certain prior cancer type (prostate, breast, gynecological, hematological), time of diagnosis (>5 years ago), or stage (in situ/localized) did not have inferior survival compared with patients with no prior cancer. We tested one form of prior cancer exclusion criteria in an NPC cohort resembling a modern trial population: it did not adversely affect overall and NPC-specific survival. Conclusions: Many NPC trials excluded patients with prior cancer, which impacts trial accrual and generalizability. Our findings suggest that broader inclusion in trials of patients with NPC with prior cancer might not affect trial outcomes. More research is needed to understand the appropriateness of this exclusion policy across cancer types and trials. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85060757798

Methods: Retrospective IRB-approved review of our database identified 8085 women who underwent ultrasound evaluation for breast pain from 1/1/2013-12/31/2013. Of 8085 women, 559 women had mammogram evaluation preceding the ultrasound and these women comprise the basis of this study. The patient′s age, type of mammogram examination (screening or diagnostic), Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density (BD), type of breast pain (focal, diffuse, cyclical, unilateral, bilateral), additional breast symptoms (palpable concern, nipple discharge, skin changes, others), mammogram or ultrasound findings and final BI-RADS assessment, follow-up imaging, and follow-up biopsy results were reviewed and recorded. Results: The median age of patients was 46 years old (range: 27-97). Patients recalled from negative screening mammogram were 29.8% (167/559). Patients with preceding negative diagnostic mammogram were 70.2% (392/559). The BI-RADS BD distribution was BD1: 5.5%, BD2: 39.9%, BD3: 46.0%, BD4: 8.6%. Final BI-RADS assessments were BI-RADS 1/2 (79%), BI-RADS 3 (12.9%), BI-RADS 4 (8.1%), BI-RADS 5 (0%). Majority (66.9%, 374/559) of the patient had breast pain alone. Additional breast symptoms were also noted as follows: palpable concern (24%), nipple discharge (3.9%), skin changes or other (5.2%). On follow-up evaluation, 26 findings were recommended for tissue sampling yielding 2 malignancies (0.4%, 2/559) in 2 patients. In the setting of negative mammogram and clinical symptom of breast pain alone yielded no malignances (NPV, 100%, 374/374) and was not impacted by BD. In patients with additional symptoms accompanying pain, malignancies were present despite negative mammogram in 2 patients; nipple discharge (4.5%, 1/22), and palpable concern (0.7%, 1/134). Conclusion: In the setting of negative mammogram and breast pain alone, additional evaluation with ultrasound is likely low yield and may be unnecessary. However, with additional symptoms such as palpable concern or nipple discharge, ultrasound is likely an important adjunct modality for identifying mammographically occult tumors. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85041918674

In patients pursuing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for NC-LCIS, the need for wide surgical margins is controversial. We characterized the outcomes of women diagnosed with NC-LCIS at a large, academic medical center. Methods: Female patients seen at our institution from 2008 to 2018 with pure NC-LCIS were retrospectively identified. Patients were excluded if NC-LCIS was diagnosed in the background of invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were collected. Rates of upstage, re-excision, and recurrence were calculated. Results: We identified 26 patients with pure NC-LCIS diagnosed on biopsy. 80.8% of patients initially pursued breast conservation, while 19.2% underwent mastectomy. At definitive surgery, 11.5% were upstaged. Among 19 non-upstaged patients that underwent BCS, 47.4% had at least one re-excision and 26.3% converted to mastectomy. In patients receiving BCS without completion mastectomy, 64.3% had final surgical margins that were negative for NC-LCIS, while 35.7% had positive or close margins. No recurrences in patients with negative margins were observed. One patient with positive margins developed a recurrence 8.3 years post-surgery, and one patient with close margins did 2.2 years post-surgery. All non-upstaged patients were alive at time of analysis with no evidence of invasive disease. Conclusion: We presented the outcomes of one of the largest series of pure NC-LCIS. In patients with NC-LCIS pursuing breast conservation, re-excisions and completion mastectomies were common. However, when negative margins were achieved, prognosis was excellent. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85061312783

Although the histologic parameters of a GCT are not always predictive of biologic behavior, the presence of atypical features may be indicative of an aggressive clinical behavior (recurrence and metastases). A preoperative estimate of features suggestive of malignancy is important for treatment and prognostication. Diagnosis and prognostication from preoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is hampered by the fact that only a few case reports on cytologic features of malignant GCT have been published.

The study involved creating a number of semioval water phantoms with the diameter of the larger axis representing the breast separation and the shorter axis representing the distance from the chest wall to the apex of the breast. Multiple plans with 2 tangential fields were created for each phantom using different transmission penetration depths (TPDs) to determine the optimum TPD value based on the evaluation of dose uniformity and maximum hot spot. Optimum TPD values from the semioval water phantom plans were plotted on a graph as a function of separation and radius and were used as guidelines to choose the optimum TPD for the breast patient's cases. A total of 10 patients who had been treated with radiation therapy using ECOMP tangential fields were randomly selected. The separation and the radius of the breast were measured for 3 regions (superior, middle, and inferior) to retrospectively determine the optimum TPD from the graph for each region. These TPD values were then used to plan the breast cases. For all the patients studied, the optimized TPD technique produced a lower average homogeneity index (HI) value of 0.658 than the standard ECOMP technique of 0.856. These results showed that optimized TPD technique produced a more homogeneous dose distribution than the standard ECOMP technique. By measuring the breast size based on breast separation and the chest wall-to-apex distance at different locations along the superior-inferior axis of the breast, the optimum TPD can be determined at each location to provide a homogeneous dose distribution. A module can be created within the planning system to automatically assign the optimum TPD for both tangential fields so uniform fluence maps can be achieved throughout the whole breast volume. This method can serve as a guideline in ECOMP during the treatment planning to obtain a homogeneous dose distribution. © 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85042946526

We sought to identify demographic, health-related, and attitudinal factors that are most predictive of continued breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening decisions in older adults under various scenarios. A sample of adults age 65+ (n = 1272) were recruited from a nationally representative panel in November 2016, of which 881 (69.3%) completed our survey. Participants were presented vignettes in which we experimentally varied a hypothetical patient's life expectancy, age, quality of life, and physician screening recommendation. The dependent variable was the choice to continue cancer screening in the vignette. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify characteristics most predictive of screening decisions; both the participants’ characteristics and the hypothetical patient's characteristics in the vignettes were included in the analysis. CART analysis uses recursive partitioning to create a classification tree in which variables predictive of the outcome are included as hierarchical tree nodes. We used automated ten-fold cross-validation to select the tree with lowest misclassification and highest predictive accuracy. Participants’ attitude towards cancer screening was most predictive of choosing screening. Among those who agreed with the statement “I plan to get screened for cancer for as long as I live” (n = 300, 31.9%), 73.2% chose screening and 57.2% would still choose screening if hypothetical patient had 1-year life expectancy.

Previous studies reported an increase in early onset colorectal cancer, which could partly reflect the obesity epidemic. We examined age-specific contemporary incidence trends in the USA for 30 common cancers, including 12 obesity-related cancers. Methods: We obtained incidence data for invasive cancers among people aged 25–84 years diagnosed from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, for 25 population-based state registries in the USA. All patients in the registry were included in the analyses. We considered the 20 most common cancer types and 12 obesity-related cancers (30 cancer types in total). We used age-period-cohort modelling to estimate average annual percentage change in incidence rates by 5-year age group (25–29 years to 80–84 years in 5-year increments) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) by birth cohort (10-year overlapping birth cohorts from 1910–19 to 1980–89 in 5-year increments). No exclusion criteria were applied after including all invasive cancer cases based on age group and diagnosis year. Findings: From 1995 to 2014 there were 14 672 409 incident cases for 30 types of cancer. Incidence significantly increased for six of 12 obesity-related cancers (multiple myeloma, colorectal, uterine corpus, gallbladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer) in young adults (25–49 years) with steeper rises in successively younger generations. Annual increases ranged from 1·44% (95% CI −0·60 to 3·53) for multiple myeloma to 6·23% (5·32–7·14) for kidney cancer at age 25–29 years, and ranged from 0·37% (0·03–0·72) for uterine corpus cancer to 2·95% (2·74–3·16) for kidney cancer at age 45–49 years. Compared with people born around 1950, IRRs for those born around 1985 ranged from 1·59 (95% CI 1·14–2·21) for multiple myeloma to 4·91 (4·27–5·65) for kidney cancer. Conversely, incidence in young adults increased in successively younger generations for only two cancers (gastric non-cardia cancer and leukaemia), and decreased for eight of the 18 additional cancers, including smoking and HIV infection-associated cancers. Interpretation: The risk of developing an obesity-related cancer seems to be increasing in a stepwise manner in successively younger birth cohorts in the USA. Further studies are needed to elucidate exposures responsible for these emerging trends, including excess bodyweight and other risk factors.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the positive predictive value of AD on diagnostic DBT, and evaluate associations between AD characteristics and histopathologic outcomes. Methods: This IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study included diagnostic DBT exams performed between 1/2014 and 12/2015 that demonstrated AD. Imaging characteristics of AD, corresponding ultrasound and MRI exams, and pathology results were reviewed. Fisher's exact tests and a two-tailed t-test were performed. Results: Seventy-seven cases of AD were visualized in 68 patients (ages 36–78 years, mean 54 years). Core biopsy of 74 cases of AD yielded malignant pathology in 26/74 (35%) tissue samples. Among 48/74 (65%) non-malignant cases of AD, 25 demonstrated a high-risk lesion, including radial scar in 20, with no upgrades to malignancy among 20 high-risk lesions that underwent surgical excision. Among 23 non high-risk causes of benign AD, stromal fibrosis was most common, present in 12 biopsy specimens.

However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the association between diabetes and wound complications in mastectomy and breast reconstruction. This study evaluates the impact of diabetes on surgical outcomes after mastectomy procedures and implant-based breast reconstruction. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database review from 2010 to 2015 identified patients undergoing total, partial, or subcutaneous mastectomy, as well as immediate or delayed implant reconstruction. Primary outcomes included postoperative wound complications and implant failure. Preoperative variables and outcomes were compared between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Multivariate regression was used to control for confounders. Results: The following groups were identified: partial (n = 52,583), total (n = 41,540), and subcutaneous mastectomy (n = 3145), as well as immediate (n = 4663) and delayed (n = 4279) implant reconstruction. Diabetes was associated with higher rates of superficial incisional surgical site infection (SSI) in partial mastectomy (odds ratio [OR] = 8.66; P = 0.03). Diabetes was also associated with higher rates of deep incisional SSI (OR = 1.61; P = 0.01) in subcutaneous mastectomy and both superficial (OR = 1.56; P = 0.04) and deep incisional SSI (OR = 2.07; P = 0.04) in total mastectomy. Diabetes was not associated with any wound complications in immediate reconstruction but was associated with higher rates of superficial incisional SSI (OR = 17.46; P < 0.001) in the delayed reconstruction group. There was no association with implant failure in either group. Conclusions: Evaluation of the largest national cohort of mastectomy and implant reconstructive procedures suggests that diabetic patients are at significantly increased risk of 30-d postoperative infectious wound complications but present no difference in rates of early implant failure. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055539985

In the EPIPHANY registry, adapted versions of common rules (the Hestia criteria, Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index [PESI], and simplified PESI [sPESI]) displayed high sensitivity for prognosticating mortality in PE patients with cancer. These adapted rules have yet to be externally validated. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the performance of an adapted Hestia criteria, PESI, and sPESI for predicting 30-day post-PE mortality in patients with cancer. We identified consecutive, adults presenting with objectively confirmed PE and cancer to our institution (November 2010 to January 2014). The proportion of patients categorized as low or high risk by these three risk stratification rules was calculated, and each rule’s accuracy for predicting 30-day all-cause mortality was determined. Of the 124 patients with PE and active cancer identified, 25 (20%) experienced mortality at 30 days. The adapted Hestia criteria categorized 23 (19%) patients as low risk, while exhibiting a sensitivity of 88% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68–97%), a negative predictive value NPV of 87% (95% CI = 65–97%), and a specificity of 20% (95% CI = 13–30%). A total of 38 (31%) and 30 (24%) patients were low risk by the adapted PESI and sPESI, with both displaying sensitivities of 92% and NPVs > 93%. Specificities were 36% (95% CI = 27–47%) and 28% (95% CI = 20–38%) for PESI and sPESI. In our external validation, the adapted Hestia, PESI, and sPESI demonstrated high sensitivity but low specificity for 30-day PE mortality in patients with cancer.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) selectively target cancer cells with DNA repair deficiencies such as those caused by BRCA1 mutations or ERCC1 defects. Using isogenic cell lines and patient-derived samples, we showed that ERCC1-defective non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells exhibit an enhanced type I IFN transcriptomic signature and that low ERCC1 expression correlates with increased lymphocytic infiltration. We demonstrated that clinical PARPi, including olaparib and rucaparib, have cell-autonomous immunomodulatory properties in ERCC1-defective NSCLC and BRCA1-defective triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Mechanistically, PARPi generated cytoplasmic chromatin fragments with characteristics of micronuclei; these were found to activate cGAS/STING, downstream type I IFN signaling, and CCL5 secretion. Importantly, these effects were suppressed in PARP1-null TNBC cells, suggesting that this phenotype resulted from an on-target effect of PARPi on PARP1. PARPi also potentiated IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cell lines and in fresh patient tumor cells; this effect was enhanced in ERCC1-deficient contexts.

Our aim was to describe PC referral among patients with advanced cancer, and associated outcomes in an academic medical centre. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 536 inpatients with cancer who had died in 2010. Our retrospective study compared patients who accessed PC services with those who did not. Statistical analysis was conducted using non-parametric tests due to non-normal distribution. We also conducted a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model including age, gender, type of cancer and metastatic status. RESULTS: Out of 536 patients, 239 (45%) had PC referral. The most common cancer types were respiratory (22%) and gastrointestinal (19%). Patients with breast cancer (OR 23.76; CI 6.12 to 92.18) and gynaecological cancer (OR 7.64; CI 2.61 to 22.35) had greater PC access than patients with respiratory or haematological cancer. Patients referred to PC had significantly less chemotherapy in the last 2 weeks of life than non-referred patients, with 22 patients (9%) vs 59 (19%; p<0.001). PC-referred patients had significantly fewer admissions to intensive care units in the last month of life than non-referred patients, with 14 (6%) vs 58 (20%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a large variation in access to PC according to the type of cancer. There is a need to improve collaboration between the PC service and the respiratory, cancer and haematology specialists. Further research will be required to determine the modality and the impact of this collaboration. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Furthermore, it is unknown whether interventions also yield long-term positive changes. The present study experimentally tests if an intervention delivered at cancer diagnosis could yield broad, long-term, changes in domains such as relationships, worldview, priorities, and goals. It was hypothesized that the intervention group would report more positive and fewer negative life changes during survivorship versus the control group. Method: Patients with Stage II/III breast cancer were randomized to biobehavioral intervention (BBI) or assessment only. At randomization, patients completed measures of cancer stress (Impact of Events Scale [IES]) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale [CES-D]). At the 24-month follow-up, survivors (N = 160) completed a thought listing task with 7 prompts (e.g., ""relationships""). Patients listed thoughts about change since diagnosis and rated each for valence. Groups were compared on the frequency of positive/negative thoughts across prompts. Listed thoughts were content analyzed. Results: BBI survivors reported significantly more positive changes (p < .05), controlling for IES and CES-D. Groups did not differ on negative changes. Patients with higher IES/CES-D scores reported more negative changes at 24 months (ps < .05). Content analysis revealed a predominance (13/23) of positive thought categories. Conclusions: Adding support for efficacy, BBI survivors reported significantly more positive life changes since diagnosis than survivors not receiving BBI. More generally, heightened stress/depressive symptoms at diagnosis foretold survivors' reporting of more negative changes.

We sought to identify a global immune gene signature that is applicable to all human cancers. Results: We identified an immune gene signature that was intimately correlated with tumor immune characteristics of human cancers and consisted of 382 genes indicative of different immune cell types. The T helper type 1 and 2 cell activation pathway was most significantly enriched in this global immune gene set, while transcription factors, such as SPI1 and STAT family members, were the top regulators of this gene signature. Skin cutaneous melanoma with higher expression of this immune gene signature had significantly longer survival than those with lower immune gene expression. Breast cancer patients with higher immune gene signature were significantly associated with advanced-stage. Methods: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of 10,062 tumor samples from 32 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer data set. Hierarchical clustering analysis of previously-defined immune genes was performed to identify a pan-cancer immune gene signature. Pathway and upstream regulator analyses were used to identify significantly enriched signaling pathways and transcription factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the survival difference between dichotomic groups with different immune gene signatures. Correlation of immune gene signature with tumor stage was also examined. Conclusions: Our identified immune gene signature is applicable in human cancers and can be used to characterize tumor immunogenicity within and across cancer types. Clinical implication of this immune gene set warrants future investigation. Copyright: Liu.

Early intervention might reduce morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization costs; however, current clinical and histologic features are unreliable SCAR predictors. There is a need to identify rational markers of SCARs that could lead to effective therapeutic interventions. Objective: To characterize the clinical and serologic features of hospitalized patients with cancer who developed SCARs. Methods: Retrospective review of 49 hospitalized cancer patients with a morbilliform rash, recorded testing for serum cytokines (interleukin [IL] 6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF] α) or elafin, and a prior dermatology consultation. Patients were categorized as having a simple morbilliform rash without systemic involvement or complex morbilliform rash with systemic involvement. Results: Fifteen out of 49 patients (30.6%) were deceased at 6 months from time of dermatologic consultation. Elafin, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly higher in patients who died compared with patients who were still alive at 6 months. IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in patients with a drug-related complex rash. Limitations: Retrospective design, limited sample size, and high-risk patient population.

Currently, SR is computed manually and, thus, user dependent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a new tool assist strain ratio (ASR) and determine how it performs compared with an expert sonologist. Methods Ninety-one patients scheduled for breast biopsy were included in this institutional review board-approved/Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study. For manual strain ratio (MSR), fat and lesion were manually outlined, whereas for ASR, the clinician indicated the lesion center and the fat-to-lesion ratio is computed automatically. Three measurements were obtained for each lesion. The same raw data were used to calculate the MSR and ASR. Results The SR thresholds to differentiate benign from malignant tumors were determined using the Youden index. For MSR, the cutoff was 2.7, and for ASR was 2.8. The MSR showed a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 64%, accuracy of 77%, positive predictive value of 72%, and negative predictive value of 92.1%. Corresponding ASR showed a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 76%, accuracy of 81%, positive predictive value of 79%, and negative predictive value of 84%. The areas under the curve for the MSR and ASR were 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. The average coefficients of variation for the MSR and ASR measurements were 43% and 30%, respectively. Conclusion Assist strain ratio demonstrated similar diagnostic performance compared with MSR. In addition, the coefficient of variation of ASR is lower, implying lower intraoperator dependency. Thus, ASR may aid less-experienced scanners in obtaining improved results. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062538238

Methods: The trial enrolled 2 independent cohorts with histologically diagnosed recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer who responded to platinum rechallenge, on the basis of germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutation (gBRCAmut) status. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo once daily until disease progression.

Adverse events (AEs) of special interest were based on the known safety profile of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. Results: Patients aged ≥70 years in the gBRCAmut cohort receiving niraparib (n = 14) had not yet reached a median PFS compared with a median PFS of 3.7 months for the same age group in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01 to 0.73]).

While there are a number of strategies researchers may employ to address these challenges, one of the most successful of these has been the use of community health workers (CHWs). Despite the documented success of CHWs, little information exists on the use of theory-driven intervention strategies with these community partners. Researchers who have partnered with CHWs tend to provide brief descriptions of training strategies and provide little discussion of the challenges and barriers to training a lay population in the delivery of technical interventions, including ensuring fidelity to the intervention protocol. The purpose of this article is to describe the feasibility of training CHWs to deliver a motivational interviewing intervention to promote cancer screening in underserved populations. With this article we present an innovative way to use motivational interviewing delivered by CHWs. Specifically, we will detail the development of the training protocol, the implementation of that training in a variety of research settings, and the development and implementation of fidelity protocols. We will use examples from two research studies where CHWs were successfully trained to use MI to promote cancer screening in underserved communities to highlight the challenges and barriers faced in developing and implementing the training and strategies used to overcome these challenges during the refinement of the intervention. © 2018 Society for Public Health Education.","Final",,2-s2.0-85044575562

A retrospective review of our database was performed between 11/2006 and 11/2011 to identify patients diagnosed with LN, and underwent annual screening. Patients with a lifetime risk >20% per risk modeling were excluded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and cancer detection rate (CDR) of each screening test were identified. Cancer type and detection modality were recorded. A total of 100 patients who had M and/or US screening were included. Mean patient age was 54.7 years (range 33-83). All 100 patients underwent a mean of 3.9 rounds of screening M and 93 (93%) received US screening (mean 3.3 rounds). Of 93 patients who received both M and US screening, 12 (13%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Mammographic CDR was 4%. Incremental US CDR was 6.5%.

Here, we present a statistical approach that extracts doubling times from progression-free survival (PFS) plots, which inherently contains information regarding the growth of solid tumors. Twelve cancers were investigated and multiple PFS plots were evaluated for each type. The PFS plot showing fastest tumor growth was deemed to best represent the inherent growth kinetics of the solid tumor, and selected for further analysis. The exponential tumor growth rates were extracted from each PFS plot, along with associated variabilities, which ultimately allowed for the estimation of solid tumor doubling times. The mean simulated doubling times for pancreatic cancer, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), renal cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive (HER-2+) breast cancer, gastric cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer were 5.06, 3.78, 3.06, 2.67, 2.38, 2.40, 4.31, 4.12, and 3.84 months, respectively. For all cancers, clinically reported doubling times were within the estimated ranges. For all cancers, except HCC, the growth rates were best characterized by a log-normal distribution. For HCC, the gamma distribution best described the data. The statistical approach presented here provides a qualified method for extracting tumor growth rates and doubling times from PFS plots. It also allows estimation of the distributional characteristics for tumor growth rates and doubling times in a given patient population. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061262966

The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the possible effects of Brief Behavioral Therapy for Cancer-Related Insomnia (BBT-CI), delivered during chemotherapy visits, on QOL and HRV in patients with breast cancer (BC). Method: QOL and HRV data were obtained during a pilot clinical trial assessing the feasibility and effects of BBT-CI on insomnia. A total of 71 BC patients (mean age = 52.5 years) were randomly assigned to either BBT-CI or a healthy-eating control intervention (HEAL). BBT-CI and HEAL were delivered over 6 weeks (2 face-to-face sessions plus 4 phone calls) by trained staff at 4 National Cancer Institute-funded Community Oncology Research Program clinics. QOL was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) and HRV with the Firstbeat device at baseline and after intervention. Results: There were significant improvements in QOL after intervention for BBT-CI (FACT-G, p = .009; FACT-B, p = .016; ANCOVA) and 5-min supine HRV measures (SDNN, p = .005; rMSSD, p = .004; HF, p = .009; ANCOVA) compared with HEAL.

For example, old age is the most significant risk factor for cancer and among people who suffer from cancer, >60% are above the age of 65. Oxidative stress and DNA damage, leading to genomic instability and telomere dysfunction, are prevalent in aging and radiation-induced damage and are major cellular events that lead to senescence. Human exposures from nuclear fallout, cosmic radiation and clinical radiotherapy (RT) are some common sources of irradiation that affect bone tissue. RT has been used to treat malignant tumors for over a century, but the effects of radiation damage on tumor-adjacent normal tissue has largely been overlooked. There is an increase in the percent survivorship among patients post-RT, and it is in older survivors where the deleterious synergy between aging and radiation exposure conspires to promote tissue deterioration and dysfunction which then negatively impacts their quality of life. Thus, an aging skeleton is already pre-disposed to architectural deterioration, which is further worsened by radiation-induced bone damage. Effects of senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) have been implicated in age-associated bone loss, but their roles in radiation-associated bone damage are still elusive. RT is used in treatment for a variety of cancers and in different anatomical locations, the sequelae of which include long-term morbidity and lifelong discomfort. Therefore, consideration of the growing evidence that implicates the role of senescence in radiation-induced bone damage argues in favor of exploiting current senotherapeutic approaches as a possible prevention or treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058228253

However, limited data exist on the impact of such access on oncology patients, and concerns remain regarding potential harms. Therefore, we determined the baseline perceptions and impact of open access to oncology notes on radiation oncology patients. Methods and materials: Patients receiving radiation therapy were provided instructional materials on accessing oncology notes at the time of their initial evaluation. Patients were prospectively surveyed to evaluate baseline interest and expectations before access and to determine the actual usage and impact at the end of their radiation treatment course. Results: A total of 220 patients were surveyed; 136 (62%) completed the baseline survey, of which 88 (40%) completed the final survey. The majority of participants were age >60 years (n = 83; 61%), and 70 were male (51%). Before accessing the notes, the majority of patients agreed that open access to oncology notes would improve understanding of diagnosis (99%), understanding of treatment side effects (98%), reassurance about treatment goals (96%), and communication with family (99%). All patients who accessed the notes found them to be useful. After accessing the notes, approximately 96%, 94%, and 96% of patients reported an improved understanding of their diagnosis, an improved understanding of treatment side effects, and feeling more reassured about their treatment, respectively. Approximately 11%, 6%, and 4% of patients noted increased worry, increased confusion, and finding information they now regret reading, respectively. Patient age, sex, and specific cancer diagnoses were not predictive of experiencing negative effects from accessing the notes. Conclusions: Radiation oncology patients have a strong interest in open access to their physician notes, and the majority of patients expect and actually report meaningful benefits.

Moreover, increased Fzd expression is associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite these findings, there are no in vivo studies investigating the potential of targeting Wnt receptors for treating gastric cancer, and the specific Wnt receptor transmitting oncogenic Wnt signaling in gastric cancer is unknown. Here, we use inhibitors of Wnt/Fzd (OMP-18R5/vantictumab) and conditional gene deletion to test the therapeutic potential of targeting Wnt signaling in preclinical models of intestinal-type gastric cancer and ex vivo organoid cultures. Pharmacologic targeting of Fzd inhibited the growth of gastric adenomas in vivo. We identified Fzd7 to be the predominant Wnt receptor responsible for transmitting Wnt signaling in human gastric cancer cells and mouse models of gastric cancer, whereby Fzd7-deficient cells were retained in gastric adenomas but were unable to respond to Wnt signals and consequently failed to proliferate. Genetic deletion of Fzd7 or treatment with vantictumab was sufficient to inhibit the growth of gastric adenomas with or without mutations to Apc. Vantictumab is currently in phase Ib clinical trials for advanced pancreatic, lung, and breast cancer. Our data extend the scope of patients that may benefit from this therapeutic approach as we demonstrate that this drug will be effective in treating patients with gastric cancer regardless of APC mutation status. Significance: The Wnt receptor Fzd7 plays an essential role in gastric tumorigenesis irrespective of Apc mutation status, therefore targeting Wnt/Fzd7 may be of therapeutic benefit to patients with gastric cancer. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062267859

Experimental Design: Gene expression profile of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was explored in a dataset of 16,000 samples, including approximately 4,000 metastatic tumors, across >25 tumor types prevalent in the United States, looking for new indications for the programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab. PD-L1 expression was highly concordant with several genomic signatures indicative of immune-inflamed tumor microenvironment. Prevalence of activated immune-inflamed tumors across all tumor types was explored and used to rank tumor types for potential response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Results: The analysis yielded 3 tiers of indications in which high levels of PD-L1 and immune-inflamed signatures were found in up to 40% to 60%, 20% to 40%, and 0% to 20% of tumors. Tier 1 contained novel indications known at the time of analysis to be responsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade in the clinic (such as melanoma and non–small cell lung cancer), as well as indications not studied in the clinic previously, including microsatellite instability–high colorectal, head and neck, bladder, and triple-negative breast cancers. Complementary analysis of an Asian/Pacific cancer dataset (gastric cancer) revealed high prevalence of immune-inflamed tumors in gastric cancer. These data contributed to prioritization of these indications for clinical development of pembrolizumab as monotherapy.

This case study describes how adjustment of her driving posture affected measures of muscle fatigue (sEMG) and driving performance (lap-time). Methods: Bilateral surface electromyographic activity of sternocleidomastoid, cervical erector spinae, anterior deltoid and pectoralis major, angles of inclination of the cervical and lumbar spine in the sagittal plane and lap-times were measured at: 1) baseline, 2) after an initial adjustment of driving posture, and 3) after a readjustment of driving posture.

By extending those initial findings to pre-clinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, we discovered a distinct mechanism by which inhibition of DPP4 improves anti-tumor responses. Administration of the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin resulted in higher concentrations of the chemokine CCL11 and increased migration of eosinophils into solid tumors. Enhanced tumor control was preserved in mice lacking lymphocytes and was ablated after depletion of eosinophils or treatment with degranulation inhibitors. We further demonstrated that tumor-cell expression of the alarmin IL-33 was necessary and sufficient for eosinophil-mediated anti-tumor responses and that this mechanism contributed to the efficacy of checkpoint-inhibitor therapy. These findings provide insight into IL-33- and eosinophil-mediated tumor control, revealed when endogenous mechanisms of DPP4 immunoregulation are inhibited. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061852115

We investigated the metabolism of CP in humans, dogs, cats, and mice using liver microsomes; apparent KM, Vmax, and intrinsic clearance (Vmax/KM) parameters were estimated. The interspecies and intraspecies variations in kinetics were vast. Dog microsomes were, on average, 55-fold more efficient than human microsomes, 2.8-fold more efficient than cat microsomes, and 1.2-fold more efficient than mouse microsomes at catalyzing CP bioactivation. These differences translated to cell-based systems. Breast cancer cells exposed to 4OHCP via CP bioactivation by microsomes resulted in a stratification of cytotoxicity that was dependent on the species of microsomes measured by IC50: dog (31.65 mM), mouse (44.95 mM), cat (272.6 mM), and human (1857 mM). The contributions of cytochrome P450s, specifically, CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP3A, to CP bioactivation were examined: CYP3A inhibition resulted in no change in 4OHCP formation; CYP2B inhibition slightly reduced 4OHCP in humans, cats, and mice; and CYP2C inhibition drastically reduced 4OHCP formation in each species. Semiphysiologic modeling of CP metabolism using scaled metabolic parameters resulted in simulated data that closely matched published pharmacokinetic profiles, determined by noncompartmental analysis. The results highlight differential CP metabolism delineated by species and demonstrate the importance of metabolism on CP clearance. © 2019 American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapy.

Design and Sample: An Idaho public health department implemented a tailored message mammography campaign on Facebook during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Target sample for the Facebook campaign were women and men over the age of 40 in rural Idaho. Measures: Data collected from Facebook were used to measure and stratify engagement into a hierarchy of six levels, with intent to get a mammogram representing the highest level of engagement. A survey measuring women's intent to a get a mammogram was distributed via an online link. Results: The posts reached 48,503 Facebook users—11,147 of the total reach were unique users. Intent to get a mammogram, the highest level of engagement, was stated both in Facebook comments and on the online survey. Forty-nine women completed the survey, and 82% of women expressed intent to get a mammogram in the next year.

An earlier report by Nissenbaum et al. claimed that particular polymorphisms in the gene CACNG2 are associated with the risk of developing chronic PMP after breast surgery (Nissenbaum J, Devor M, Seltzer Z, Gebauer M, Michaelis M, Tal M, Dorfman R, Abitbul-Yarkoni M, Lu Y, Elahipanah T, delCanho S, Minert A, Fried K, Persson AK, Shpigler H, Shabo E, Yakir B, Pisante A, Darvasi A. Susceptibility to chronic pain following nerve injury is genetically affected by CACNG2. Genome Res 2010;20:1180-90). This information is important because in principle, it can inform the surgical, radiological, and chemotherapeutic decision-making process in ways that could mitigate the increased risk of chronic pain. In this study, we revisited this claim by independently evaluating the proposed marker haplotype using 2 different patient cohorts recruited in different research settings. Meta-analysis of these new postmastectomy cohorts and the original cohort confirmed significant association of the CACNG2 haplotype with PMP. In addition, we tested whether the same markers would predict chronic postsurgical pain in men who underwent surgery for inguinal hernia repair, and whether there is significant genetic association with cutaneous thermal sensitivity in postmastectomy and postherniotomy patients. We found that the biomarker is selective because it did not predict pain after laparoscopic hernia repair and was not associated with pain sensitivity to experimentally applied noxious thermal stimuli. We conclude that the A-C-C haplotype at the 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs4820242, rs2284015, and rs2284017) in the CACNG2 gene is associated with increased risk of developing PMP. This information may advance current knowledge on pathophysiology of PMP and serve as a step forward in the prediction of clinical outcomes and personalized pain management.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061574814

Methods and Materials: We investigated 67NR murine orthotopic breast tumors in both immunocompetent and nude mice. Treatment was delivered to 50% or 100% of the tumor using a 2 × 2 cm collimator on a microirradiator. Radiation response was modulated by treatment with anti-CD8 and anti—intercellular adhesion molecule (anti-ICAM) antibodies. Similar experiments were performed using the less immunogenic Lewis lung carcinoma mouse model. Tumor growth delay and γ-H2AX phosphorylation were measured, and immune response was assessed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry at 1 and 7 days after radiation therapy. Tumor expression of cellular adhesion molecules was also measured at different times after radiation therapy. Results: Partial irradiation led to tumor responses similar to those of fully exposed tumors in immunocompetent mice, but not in nude mice. After a single dose of 10 Gy, infiltration of CD8 + T cells was observed along with increased expression of ICAM. The response to 10 Gy in hemi-irradiated tumors was abrogated by treatment with either anti-CD8 or anti-ICAM antibodies. Similar responses were obtained in the less immunogenic Lewis lung carcinoma mouse model delivering 15 Gy to half the tumor volume. Treatment with FTY720, a compound that inhibits T-cell egress from lymph nodes, did not affect tumor response at the time of CD8 + T cells infiltration in the nonirradiated area of the tumor. This result indicated that the most likely source of these cells is the irradiated portion of the hemi-irradiated tumors. In addition, a significant abscopal effect was observed after partial irradiation with a single dose of 10 Gy in the 67NR model. Conclusions: In these models, radiation controls tumor growth both directly through cell killing and indirectly through immune activation. This outcome raises the possibility that this effect could be induced in the clinic. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059353316

For example, the Top Scoring Pair (TSP) method seeks to find pairs of genes so that the probability of the reversal of the relative ranking of the expression levels of the genes in the two classes is maximized. The computational cost of finding a q-tuple of genes that scores highest under a given metric is O(Gq), where G is the total number of genes. This cost is often problematic or prohibitive in practice (even for q=2), as the number of genes G is often in the order of tens of thousands. Methods: In this paper, we show that this computational cost can be significantly reduced by excluding from consideration genes whose behavior is almost identical in the two classes and therefore their inclusion in any q-tuple is rather non-informative. Our criterion for the exclusion of genes is supported by a statistically robust metric, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. By filtering out genes whose AUC value is below a user-chosen threshold, as determined by a procedure that we describe in the paper, dramatic reductions in the run times are obtained while maintaining the same classification accuracy. Results: We have experimentally verified the gains of this approach on several case studies involving ovarian, colon, leukemia, breast and prostate cancers, and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Conclusions: The proposed method is not only faster (for example, we observed an average 78.65% reduction over the run time of TSP) while maintaining the same classification accuracy, but it can even result in better classification accuracy due to its inherent ability to avoid the so-called “pivot” (non-informative) genes that may intrude in q-tuples chosen otherwise. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060087062

The aim of this study was to evaluate online Spanish lymphedema resources. Methods A web search using the Spanish term ""linfedema"" was performed, and the top 10 websites were identified. Each was analyzed using validated metrics to assess readability, understandability, actionability, and cultural sensitivity using the SOL (Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook, Spanish), Patient Education and Materials Assessment for Understandability and Actionability (Patient Education and Assessment Tool), and Cultural Sensitivity and Assessment Tool (CSAT), respectively. Online materials were assessed by 2 independent evaluators, and interrater reliability was determined. Results Online lymphedema material in Spanish had a mean reading grade level of 9.8 (SOL). Average understandability and actionability scores were low at 52% and 36%, respectively. The mean CSAT was 2.27, below the recommended value of 2.5. Cohen κ for interrater reliability was greater than 0.81 for the Patient Education and Assessment Tool and CSAT, suggesting excellent agreement between raters.

Mutations in HRR genes can result in increased mutation rate and genomic rearrangements, and are associated with numerous genetic disorders and cancer. Despite intensive research, the HRR pathway is not yet fully mapped. Phylogenetic profiling analysis, which detects functional linkage between genes using coevolution, is a powerful approach to identify factors in many pathways. Nevertheless, phylogenetic profiling has limited predictive power when analyzing pathways with complex evolutionary dynamics such as the HRR. To map novel HRR genes systematically, we developed clade phylogenetic profiling (CladePP). CladePP detects local coevolution across hundreds of genomes and points to the evolutionary scale (e.g., mammals, vertebrates, animals, plants) at which coevolution occurred. We found that multiscale coevolution analysis is significantly more biologically relevant and sensitive to detect gene function. By using CladePP, we identified dozens of unrecognized genes that coevolved with the HRR pathway, either globally across all eukaryotes or locally in different clades. We validated eight genes in functional biological assays to have a role in DNA repair at both the cellular and organismal levels. These genes are expected to play a role in the HRR pathway and might lead to a better understanding of missing heredity in HRR-associated cancers (e.g., heredity breast and ovarian cancer).

It is unknown whether AEA can influence fetal concentrations of xenobiotics by modulating the expression of transporters in syncytiotrophoblasts. Here, we sought to characterize and identify the mechanism(s) responsible for AEA-mediated down-regulation of the BCRP transporter in human placental explants and BeWo trophoblasts. Treatment of human placental explants with AEA (1 μM, 24 h) reduced hCGα syncytin-1, and BCRP mRNAs by ˜30%. Similarly, treatment of BeWo trophoblasts with AEA (0–10 μM, 3-24 h) coordinately down-regulated mRNAs for hCGß syncytin-2, and BCRP. In turn, AEA increased the sensitivity of trophoblasts to the cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone, a known BCRP substrate, and environmental and dietary contaminants including mycoestrogens and perfluorinated chemicals. AEA-treated trophoblasts also demonstrated reduced BCRP transport of the mycoestrogen zearalenone and the diabetes drug glyburide, labeled with BODIPY. The AEA-mediated reduction of BCRP mRNA was abrogated when placental cells were co-treated with AM630, a CB2 receptor inhibitor, or 8-Br-cAMP, a cAMP analog. AEA reduced intracellular cAMP levels in trophoblasts by 75% at 1 h, and completely inhibited forskolin-induced phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). AEA also decreased p-CREB binding to the BCRP promoter. Taken together, our data indicate that AEA down-regulates placental transporter expression and activity via CB2-cAMP signaling. This novel mechanism may explain the repression of placental BCRP expression observed during diseases of pregnancy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85059954053

Since median survival time was only 2 months, a potentially negative impact by delaying treatment could have been missed. Therefore, we performed an additional analysis of patients surviving at least 4 months following irradiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The interval between diagnosis of brain metastases and WBRT and ten other factors were retrospectively analyzed for survival in 191 patients surviving 4 months or longer following WBRT. RESULTS: On univariate analyses, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-1, 1-3 brain metastases and absence of extra-cerebral metastases were significantly associated with longer survival, whereas the interval from diagnostic imaging to WBRT was not. On multivariate analysis, ECOG performance score remained significant, and extra-cerebral metastases showed a trend towards a longer survival. CONCLUSION: The interval between diagnostic imaging and WBRT didn't have a significant impact on patients surviving 4 months or longer. Depending on the need for symptom relief, WBRT may be postponed for very important reasons such as obtaining a multidisciplinary tumor board decision or definitive histology.

Targeted therapies exist, however resistance is common and patients resort to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is also a main treatment for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients; while radiation is delivered to patients with advanced disease to counteract metastasis. Yet, resistance to both chemo- and radiotherapy is still frequent, highlighting a need to provide novel sensitizers. We discovered that MT1-MMP modulates DNA damage responses (DDR) in breast cancer. MT1-MMP expression inversely correlates to chemotherapy response of breast cancer patients. Inhibition of MT1-MMP sensitizes TNBC cells to IR and doxorubicin in vitro, and in vivo in an orthotopic breast cancer model. Specifically, depletion of MT1-MMP causes stalling of replication forks and Double Strand Breaks (DBSs), leading to increased sensitivity to additional genotoxic stresses. These effects are mediated by integrinβ1, as a constitutive active integrinβ1 reverts replication defects and protects cells depleted of MT1-MMP from IR and chemotherapy. These data highlight a novel DNA damage response triggered by MT1-MMP-integrinβ1 and provide a new point of therapeutic targeting that may improve breast cancer patient outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058187010

The current study aims to determine growth inhibitory effects of SL-1-39 across the different subtypes of breast cancer cells and delineate its molecular mechanism. Our results demonstrate that while SL-1-39 blocks cell proliferation of all breast cancer subtypes tested, it has the highest efficacy against HER2+ breast cancer cells. Molecular analyses suggest that SL-1-39 prevents S phase progression of HER2+ breast cancer cells (SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453), which is consistent with reduced expression of key cell-cycle regulators at both the protein and transcriptional levels. SL-1-39 treatment also decreases the protein levels of HER2 and pHER2 as well as its downstream effectors, pMAPK and pAKT. Reduction of HER2 and pHER2 at the protein level is attributed to increased lysosomal degradation of total HER2 levels. This is the first study to show that a flexible heteroarotinoid analog modulates the HER2 signaling pathway through lysosomal degradation, and thus further warrants the development of SL-1-39 as a therapeutic option for HER2+ breast cancer. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85058420529

Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that downregulates the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Using trastuzumab to treat women with localized HER2-positive breast cancer has been shown to improve survival. The objective of this study is to explore the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab, from a societal perspective, in 11 African countries. In addition, we aimed to establish value-based prices for trastuzumab based on the gross domestic product per capita in each country. Methods: We developed a Markov model in order to assess the costs and benefits associated with trastuzumab treatment over a lifetime horizon. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in order to estimate the impact of uncertainty of parameter-values on the results. Efficacy inputs were derived using clinical trial data from non-African countries. Results: In the base case analysis, trastuzumab yielded a gain ranging from 0.92 LYs in Nigeria to 1.07 LYs in South Africa, and 0.9 QALYs in Nigeria to 1.02 QALYs in South Africa. The incremental cost ranged from 19,561 USD in Nigeria to 19,997 USD in Congo, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from 19,534 USD/QALY in South Africa to 21,697 USD/QALY in Nigeria. Using willingness to pay estimates based on World Health Organization recommendations, trastuzumab appear to not be cost-effective in all countries analyzed. Cost-effectiveness estimates were most sensitive to the discount rate, trastuzumab cost, and the hazard ratio. Conclusions: Trastuzumab does not appear to be cost effective in the African countries analyzed. In order for trastuzumab to be cost-effective, the costs of treatment would require significant discounts. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062335283

However, the high mutation rate of this obstinate cancer type renders it suitable for immunotherapy. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a high-efficiency method for inducing tumor neoantigen release in situ, which has great potential for use in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we prepared a biomimetic black phosphorus quantum dot (BPQDs) formulation to induce breast cancer cell apoptosis in situ by near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation to mobilize the immune system to eliminate the residual and metastatic cancer cells. Erythrocyte membranes (RMs) were used to coat the BPQDs, forming a BPQD-RM nanovesicle (BPQD-RMNV) biomimetic formulation that exhibited a long circulation time and tumor accumulation in vivo. The basal-like 4T1 breast tumor underwent apoptosis and necrosis with the irradiation and recruited dendritic cells (DCs) to capture the tumor antigens in vivo. Furthermore, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody (aPD-1) was employed to prevent the CD8 + T cells from exhaustion. Notably, BPQD-RMNV-mediated PTT combined with aPD-1 treatment significantly delayed residual and metastatic tumor growth in vivo. Hence, BPQD-RMNV-mediated PTT combined with immune checkpoint blockade antibody increased the infiltration and activity of CD8 + T cells in the tumor, which directly restrained basal-like breast tumor growth in vivo. © 2019","Final",,2-s2.0-85060345854

Here, we aimed to clarify its prognostic and treatment predictive potential through comprehensive long-term survival analyses. Methods: CCND1 amplification was assessed using SNP arrays from two cohorts of 1965 and 340 patients with matching gene expression array and clinical follow-up data of over 15 years. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to determine survival differences between CCND1 amplified vs. non-amplified tumours in clinically relevant patient sets, within PAM50 subtypes and within treatment-specific subgroups. Boxplots and differential gene expression analyses were performed to assess differences between amplified vs. non-amplified tumours within PAM50 subtypes. Results: When combining both cohorts, worse survival was found for patients with CCND1-amplified tumours in luminal A (HR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15-2.46), luminal B (1.37; 1.01-1.86) and ER+/LN-/HER2- (1.66; 1.14-2.41) subgroups. In gene expression analysis, CCND1-amplified luminal A tumours showed increased proliferation (P < 0.001) and decreased progesterone (P = 0.002) levels along with a large overlap in differentially expressed genes when comparing luminal A and B-amplified vs. non-amplified tumours. Conclusions: Our results indicate that CCND1 amplification is associated with worse 15-year survival in ER+/LN-/HER2-, luminal A and luminal B patients. Moreover, luminal A CCND1-amplified tumours display gene expression changes consistent with a more aggressive phenotype. These novel findings highlight the potential of CCND1 to identify patients that could benefit from long-term treatment strategies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062370592

This observation conflicts with the paradigm that removal of all visible polyps should prevent the vast majority of CRC in path-MMR carriers, provided the screening interval is sufficiently short and colonoscopic practice is optimal. Methods: To inform the debate, we examined, in the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD), whether the time since last colonoscopy was associated with the pathological stage at which CRC was diagnosed during prospective surveillance. Path-MMR carriers were recruited for prospective surveillance by colonoscopy. Only variants scored by the InSiGHT Variant Interpretation Committee as class 4 and 5 (clinically actionable) were included. CRCs detected at the first planned colonoscopy, or within one year of this, were excluded as prevalent cancers. Results: Stage at diagnosis and interval between last prospective surveillance colonoscopy and diagnosis were available for 209 patients with 218 CRCs, including 162 path-MLH1, 45 path-MSH2, 10 path-MSH6 and 1 path-PMS2 carriers. The numbers of cancers detected within < 1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5 and at > 3.5 years since last colonoscopy were 36, 93, 56 and 33, respectively. Among these, 16.7, 19.4, 9.9 and 15.1% were stage III-IV, respectively (p = 0.34). The cancers detected more than 2.5 years after the last colonoscopy were not more advanced than those diagnosed earlier (p = 0.14). Conclusions: The CRC stage and interval since last colonoscopy were not correlated, which is in conflict with the accelerated adenoma-carcinoma paradigm. We have previously reported that more frequent colonoscopy is not associated with lower incidence of CRC in path-MMR carriers as was expected. In contrast, point estimates showed a higher incidence with shorter intervals between examinations, a situation that may parallel to over-diagnosis in breast cancer screening. Our findings raise the possibility that some CRCs in path-MMR carriers may spontaneously disappear: the host immune response may not only remove CRC precursor lesions in path-MMR carriers, but may remove infiltrating cancers as well. If confirmed, our suggested interpretation will have a bearing on surveillance policy for path-MMR carriers. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062324759

Bone-resorbing osteoclasts excavate erosion cavities, and bone-depositing osteoblasts synthesize osteoid matrix that forms new bone, with no net bone gain or loss. When metastatic breast cancer cells invade the bone, this balance is disrupted. Patients with bone metastatic breast cancer frequently suffer from osteolytic bone lesions that elicit severe bone pain and fractures. Bisphosphonate treatments are not curative. Under ideal circumstances, osteoblasts would synthesize new matrix to fill in erosion cavities caused by osteoclasts, but this is not what occurs. Our prior evidence demonstrated that osteoblasts are diverted from laying down bone matrix to producing cytokines that facilitate breast cancer cell maintenance in late-stage disease. Here, we have new evidence to suggest that there are subpopulations of osteoblasts in the tumor niche as evidenced by their protein marker expression that have distinct roles in tumor progression in the bone. Methods: Tumor-bearing tibia of mice was interrogated by immunofluorescent staining for the presence of osteoblasts and alterations in niche protein expression. De-identified tissue from patients with bone metastatic breast cancer was analyzed for osteoblast subpopulations via multi-plex immunofluorescent staining. Effects of breast cancer cells on osteoblasts were recapitulated in vitro by osteoblast exposure to breast cancer-conditioned medium. Triple-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer proliferation, cell cycle, and p21 expression were assessed upon contact with ""educated"" osteoblasts. Results: A subpopulation of osteoblasts was identified in the bone tumor microenvironment in vivo of both humans and mice with bone metastatic breast cancer that express RUNX2/OCN/OPN but is negative for IL-6 and alpha-smooth muscle actin. These tumor ""educated"" osteoblasts (EOs) have altered properties compared to ""uneducated"" osteoblasts and suppress both triple-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell proliferation and increase cancer cell p21 expression. EO effects on breast cancer proliferation were mediated by NOV and decorin. Importantly, the presence of EO cells in the tibia of mice bearing tumors led to increased amounts of alkaline phosphatase and suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Conclusions: Our work reveals that there is a subpopulation of osteoblasts in the bone tumor microenvironment that demonstrate a functional role in retarding breast cancer cell growth. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062219634

Methods: ExteNET is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial involving community-based and academic institutions in 40 countries. Women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer with prior standard primary therapy and trastuzumab-based (neo)adjuvant therapy were randomized to neratinib 240 mg/day or placebo for 12 months. Safety, a secondary outcome, was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0. Health-related quality of life by diarrhea grade was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B). Results: Two thousand eight hundred sixteen women (1408 per group) were safety-evaluable. Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea occurred in 561 (39.8%) and 1 (0.1%) patients with neratinib versus 23 (1.6%) and 0 patients with placebo, respectively. In the neratinib group, 28.6% of patients had grade 3 events during month 1 decreasing to ≤ 6% after month 3. The median cumulative duration of grade 3/4 diarrhea with neratinib was 5 days (interquartile range, 2-9). Serious diarrheal events (n = 22, 1.6%) and diarrheal events requiring hospitalization (n = 20, 1.4%) were rare with neratinib. Changes in FACT-B total score by diarrhea grade in the neratinib group did not meet the threshold for clinically important differences. Conclusions: In the absence of antidiarrheal prophylaxis, neratinib-related diarrhea is short-lived and not associated with complications or long-term sequelae. This suggests that targeted preventive management with antidiarrheal prophylaxis early during neratinib treatment is appropriate. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00878709.

AR is expressed in 60-80% of breast cancers, with higher prevalence among estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors. Androgen treatment inhibits ER signaling in ER+/AR+ breast cancer cell lines, and AR expression is associated with improved survival for this subtype in epidemiologic studies. However, whether AR expression modifies the efficacy of selective ER modulators or aromatase inhibitors for ER+ cancers remains unclear. Methods: We evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of AR expression among 3021 postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer patients in the Breast International Group (BIG) trial 1-98. The BIG 1-98 study was a four-armed, double-blind, phase III randomized clinical trial that compared 5 years of tamoxifen or letrozole monotherapy, or sequences of 2 years and 3 years treatment with one drug and then the other. AR expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and the percentage of AR-positive nuclei was quantified. The association between AR expression and prognosis was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Continuous AR-by-treatment interactions were assessed using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP). Results: Eighty-two percent of patients had AR+ (≥ 1%) tumors. Patients with AR+ cancers were more likely to have smaller, lower-grade tumors, with higher expression of ER and PR. AR expression was not associated with breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) (415 events) over a median 8.0 years of follow-up (p = 0.12, log-rank test). In multivariable-adjusted models, AR expression was not associated with BCFI (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.83-1.36, p = 0.60). The letrozole versus tamoxifen monotherapy treatment effect did not significantly differ for AR+ tumors (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.75, p = 0.003) and AR- tumors (HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.72, p = 0.002) (p-heterogeneity = 0.16). STEPP analysis also suggested no heterogeneity of the treatment effect across the continuum of AR expression. Conclusions: AR expression was not associated with prognosis, nor was there heterogeneity of the letrozole versus tamoxifen treatment effect by AR expression. These findings suggest that AR expression may not be an informative biomarker for the selection of adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancers.

Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines a humanized monoclonal antibody, which targets the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), with SN-38, which is conjugated to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy enables delivery of high concentrations of SN-38 to tumors. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1/2 single-group, multicenter trial involving patients with advanced epithelial cancers who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. A total of 108 patients received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight after receiving at least two previous anticancer therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review. RESULTS: The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in ≥10% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7). CONCLUSIONS: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was associated with durable objective responses in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

This study evaluated the risk of arterial thromboembolism before cancer diagnosis. Using the population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked dataset, we identified 374 331 patients ‡67 years of age with a new primary diagnosis of breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, bladder, uterine, pancreatic, gastric cancer, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma from 2005 through 2013. Cancer patients were individually matched by demographics and comorbidities to Medicare beneficiaries without cancer, who served as controls. Validated diagnosis codes were used to identify arterial thromboembolic events, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. The Mantel-Haenszel estimator was used to compare risks of arterial thromboembolic events between cancer and noncancer groups during 30-day periods in the 360 days before date of cancer diagnosis. From 360 to 151 days before cancer diagnosis, the 30-day interval risks of arterial thromboembolic events were similar between cancer patients and matched controls. From 150 to 1 day before cancer diagnosis, the interval 30-day risks of arterial thromboembolic events were higher in cancer patients vs matched controls, progressively increasing as the cancer diagnosis date approached and peaking during the 30 days immediately before cancer diagnosis, when 2313 (0.62%) cancer patients were diagnosed with an arterial thromboembolic event vs 413 (0.11%) controls (odds ratio, 5.63; 95% confidence interval, 5.07-6.25).

Current testing guidelines for germ line susceptibility genes in patients with breast carcinoma were developed to identify carriers of BRCA1/ 2 variants and have evolved in the panel-testing era. We evaluated the capability of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to identify patients with breast cancer with pathogenic variants in expanded panel testing. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved multicenter prospective registry was initiated with 20 community and academic sites experienced in cancer genetic testing and counseling. Eligibility criteria included patients with a previously or newly diagnosed breast cancer who had not undergone either single- or multigene testing. Consecutive patients 18 to 90 years of age were consented and underwent an 80-gene panel test. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant electronic case report forms collected information on patient demographics, diagnoses, phenotypes, and test results. RESULTS: More than 1,000 patients were enrolled, and data records for 959 patients were analyzed; 49.95% met NCCN criteria, and 50.05% did not. Overall, 8.65% of patients had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. Of patients who met NCCN guidelines with test results, 9.39% had a P/LP variant. Of patients who did not meet guidelines, 7.9% had a P/LP variant. The difference in positive results between these groups was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test P = .4241). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that nearly half of patients with breast cancer with a P/LP variant with clinically actionable and/or management guidelines in development are missed by current testing guidelines. We recommend that all patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer undergo expanded panel testing.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061582379

Despite this potential, delivery of proteins remains a significant challenge due to the intrinsic size, charge, and stability of proteins. Attempts to overcome these challenges have most commonly relied on direct conjugation of polymers and peptides to proteins via reactive groups on naturally occurring residues. While such approaches have shown some success, they allow limited control of the spacing and number of moieties coupled to proteins, which can hinder bioactivity and delivery capabilities of the therapeutic. Here, we describe a strategy to site-specifically conjugate delivery moieties to therapeutic proteins through unnatural amino acid (UAA) incorporation, in order to explore the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted ligand valency and spacing on internalization of proteins in EGFR-overexpressing inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cells. Our results demonstrate the ability to enhance targeted protein delivery by tuning a small number of EGFR ligands per protein and clustering these ligands to promote multivalent ligand-receptor interactions. Furthermore, the tailorability of this simple approach was demonstrated through IBC-targeted cell death via the delivery of yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD), a prodrug converting enzyme. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061847250

Certain cancers almost universally harbor TRK fusions, including infantile fibrosarcoma, cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, secretory breast cancer, and mammary analog secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland. TRK fusions have also been identified at lower frequencies across a broad range of other pediatric cancers, including undifferentiated sarcomas, gliomas, papillary thyroid cancers, spitzoid neoplasms, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and acute leukemias. Here we review the prevalence and diseases associated with TRK fusions and methods of detection of these fusions in light of the recent development of selective TRK inhibitors, such as larotrectinib, which demonstrated a 75% response rate across children and adults with TRK fusion cancers. We provide recommendations for screening pediatric tumors for the presence of TRK fusions, including the use of immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization for patients with tumors likely to harbor TRK fusions. Further, we recommend next-generation sequencing for tumors that have a relatively low prevalence of TRK fusions, both to identify patients who may benefit from TRK inhibition and to identify other targetable oncogenic drivers that exist in the same tumor types.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061593881

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosis among women in the United States and, as decades of research have resulted in decreased mortality rates, there has been an increasing focus on reducing short- and long-term treatment toxicity and improving morbidity among survivors. Preexisting or emergent cardiovascular disease in a patient with BC requires a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to balance the need for curative cancer treatment while preventing increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Given the overlap in risk factors for BC and cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity, there are opportunities for cardiovascular disease prevention and detection before, during, and after BC treatment. Cardiology providers also play an important role in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cardiac dysfunction and other cardiovascular complications that may develop as a result of BC treatment. A number of recent clinical practice guidelines address approaches to cardiotoxicity, however, they focus on specific agents or treatment modality, rather than on collaborative disease management. In this review we present cardiovascular concerns associated with contemporary, multimodality BC treatment and illustrate how current guideline recommendations apply to clinical cardiology and oncology questions. We provide a cardio-oncology team-based approach to cardiovascular assessment and management of patients with BC from diagnosis through treatment and in survivorship.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061866401

This pilot study evaluated a pretreatment dosimetry methodology in a triple-negative breast cancer patient who was uniquely enrolled in both a CLR 124 PET imaging clinical trial and a CLR 131 therapeutic dose escalation clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional PET/CT images were acquired at 1, 3, 24, 48, and 120 h postinjection of 178 MBq CLR 124. One month later, pretherapy 2D whole-body planar images were acquired at 0.25, 5, 24, 48, and 144 h postinjection of 370 MBq CLR 131. Following the therapeutic administration of 1990 MBq CLR 131, 3D SPECT/CT images were acquired at 74, 147, 334, and 505 h postinjection. The therapeutic CLR 131 voxel-level absorbed dose was estimated from PET (RAPID PET) and SPECT (RAPID SPECT) images using a Geant4-based Monte Carlo dosimetry platform called RAPID (Radiopharmaceutical Assessment Platform for Internal Dosimetry), and region of interest (ROI) mean doses were also estimated using the OLINDA/EXM software based on PET (OLINDA PET), SPECT (OLINDA SPECT), and planar (OLINDA planar) images. Results: The RAPID PET and OLINDA PET tracer-predicted ROI mean doses correlated well (m ≥ 0.631, R 2 ≥ 0.694, p ≤ 0.01) with both the RAPID SPECT and OLINDA SPECT therapeutic mean doses. The 2D planar images did not have any significant correlations. The ROI mean doses differed by -4% to -43% between RAPID and OLINDA/EXM, and by -19% to 29% between PET and SPECT. The 3D dose distributions and dose volume histograms calculated with RAPID were similar for the PET/CT and SPECT/CT. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that CLR 124 pretreatment PET images can be used to predict CLR 131 3D therapeutic dosimetry better than CLR 131 2D planar images. In addition, unlike OLINDA/EXM, Monte Carlo dosimetry methods were capable of accurately predicting dose heterogeneity, which is important for predicting dose-response relationships and clinical outcomes. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061122883

One of the barriers to improving cardiovascular disease outcomes in women is the lack of reliable, effective screening modalities. Breast arterial calcification has emerged as a potential risk stratification tool. Localized deposition in the media of the artery, known as Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis, is notably different from the intimal atherosclerotic process commonly associated with coronary artery disease. Nonetheless, studies favor a correlation between breast arterial calcification and cardiovascular risk factors or coronary artery disease, defined as coronary artery calcification on computed tomography scan or both nonobstructive and obstructive lesions on angiography. Since a majority of women over the age of 40 undergo yearly breast cancer screening with mammography, measurement of breast arterial calcification may offer a personalized, noninvasive approach to risk-stratify women for cardiovascular disease at no additional cost or radiation. Mammography has the potential to alter the course of the leading cause of death in women, heart disease, through the evaluation of breast arterial calcification and identification of opportunities for prevention. Current evidence supports the universal reporting of breast arterial calcifications and personalized patient-provider discussions to more aggressively treat cardiac risk factors through targeted medical therapies or healthy lifestyle changes.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061853343

Despite an attractive mechanism of action, previous clinical efforts to use TRAIL receptor agonists have been unsuccessful. In this study, we examined MEDI3039, a highly potent multivalent DR5 agonist, in breast cancer cell lines and in vivo models. Methods: As in vitro model systems, we used 19 breast cancer cell lines that are categorized into four subtypes: ER+, HER2 amplified, basal A (triple-negative breast cancer) TNBC, and basal B TNBC. Cell viability was analyzed by MTS and RealTime live/dead assays. As in vivo model systems, MDA-MB231T orthotopic primary tumor growth in the mammary fat pad (MFP) and two experimental lung metastasis models were used. The effect of MEDI3039 on MFP tumors was assessed with immunohistochemical analysis. Lung metastases were analyzed with Bouin's and H&amp;E staining. Results: MEDI3039 killed multiple breast cancer cell lines, but the sensitivity varied among different subtypes. Sensitivity was basal B TNBC &gt;&gt; basal A TNBC &gt; HER2 amplified &gt; ER+ (average IC 50 = 1.4, 203, 314, 403 pM, respectively). While the pattern of relative sensitivity was similar to GST-TRAIL in most cell lines, MEDI3039 was at least two orders of magnitude more potent compared with GST-TRAIL. In the MFP model, weekly treatment with 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg MEDI3039 for 5 weeks inhibited tumor growth by 99.05% or 100% (median), respectively, compared with the control group, and extended animal survival (p = 0.08 or p = 0.0032 at 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg, respectively). MEDI3039-induced caspase activation was confirmed in tumors grown in MFP (p &lt; 0.05). In an experimental pulmonary metastasis model, MEDI3039 significantly suppressed outgrowth of surface (p &lt; 0.0001) and microscopic metastases (p &lt; 0.05). In an established lung metastasis model, MEDI3039 significantly inhibited growth of metastases (p &lt; 0.01 in surface [&gt; 4 mm], p &lt; 0.01 in tumor percentage) and extended animal survival (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: MEDI3039 is a potent DR5 agonist in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and has potential as a cancer drug in breast cancer patients, especially those with basal B TNBC. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061848949

Radioresistance remains one of the most critical barriers in radiation therapy for breast cancer. In this study, we employed a parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted proteomic method to examine the reprogramming of the heat shock proteome during the development of radioresistance in breast cancer. In particular, we investigated the differential expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in two pairs of matched parental/radioresistant breast cancer cell lines. We were able to quantify 43 and 42 HSPs in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 pairs of cell lines, respectively. By analyzing the commonly altered proteins, we found that several members of the HSP70 and HSP40 subfamilies of HSPs exhibited substantially altered expression upon development of radioresistance. Moreover, the expression of HSPB8 is markedly elevated in the radioresistant lines relative to the parental MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, our PRM-based targeted proteomics method revealed the reprogramming of the heat shock proteome during the development of radioresistance in breast cancer cells and offered potential targets for sensitizing breast cancer cells toward radiation therapy. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062086624

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the article series and to celebrate the 2018 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and in Physiology or Medicine, which were given for work that is highly relevant to antibody therapeutics research and development, we expanded the scope of the data presented to include an overview of all commercial clinical development of antibody therapeutics and approval success rates for this class of molecules. Our data indicate that: 1) antibody therapeutics are entering clinical study, and being approved, in record numbers; 2) the commercial pipeline is robust, with over 570 antibody therapeutics at various clinical phases, including 62 in late-stage clinical studies; and 3) Phase 1 to approval success rates are favorable, ranging from 17–25%, depending on the therapeutic area (cancer vs. non-cancer). In 2018, a record number (12) of antibodies (erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), galcanezumab (Emgality), burosumab (Crysvita), lanadelumab (Takhzyro), caplacizumab (Cablivi), mogamulizumab (Poteligeo), moxetumomab pasudodox (Lumoxiti), cemiplimab (Libtayo), ibalizumab (Trogarzo), tildrakizumab (Ilumetri, Ilumya), emapalumab (Gamifant)) that treat a wide variety of diseases were granted a first approval in either the European Union (EU) or United States (US). As of November 2018, 4 antibody therapeutics (sacituzumab govitecan, ravulizumab, risankizumab, romosozumab) were being considered for their first marketing approval in the EU or US, and an additional 3 antibody therapeutics developed by Chinese companies (tislelizumab, sintilimab, camrelizumab) were in regulatory review in China. In addition, our data show that 3 product candidates (leronlimab, brolucizumab, polatuzumab vedotin) may enter regulatory review by the end of 2018, and at least 12 (eptinezumab, teprotumumab, crizanlizumab, satralizumab, tanezumab, isatuximab, spartalizumab, MOR208, oportuzumab monatox, TSR-042, enfortumab vedotin, ublituximab) may enter regulatory review in 2019. Finally, we found that approximately half (18 of 33) of the late-stage pipeline of antibody therapeutics for cancer are immune checkpoint modulators or antibody-drug conjugates. Of these, 7 (tremelimumab, spartalizumab, BCD-100, omburtamab, mirvetuximab soravtansine, trastuzumab duocarmazine, and depatuxizumab mafodotin) are being evaluated in clinical studies with primary completion dates in late 2018 and in 2019, and are thus ‘antibodies to watch’.

Methods: To answer this question, we used comprehensive registries for population, screening history, breast cancer incidence, and disease-specific death data in a defined population in Dalarna County, Sweden. The annual incidence of breast cancer was calculated along with the annual incidence of breast cancers that were fatal within 10 and within 11 to 20 years of diagnosis among women aged 40 to 69 years who either did or did not participate in mammography screening during a 39-year period (1977-2015). For an additional comparison, corresponding data are presented from 19 years of the prescreening period (1958-1976). All patients received stage-specific therapy according to the latest national guidelines, irrespective of the mode of detection. Results: The benefit for women who chose to participate in an organized breast cancer screening program was a 60% lower risk of dying from breast cancer within 10 years after diagnosis (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.48) and a 47% lower risk of dying from breast cancer within 20 years after diagnosis (relative risk, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.63) compared with the corresponding risks for nonparticipants. Conclusions: Although all patients with breast cancer stand to benefit from advances in breast cancer therapy, the current results demonstrate that women who have participated in mammography screening obtain a significantly greater benefit from the therapy available at the time of diagnosis than do those who have not participated. © 2018 The Authors.

We assessed the associations between BMI and gene expression of both breast tumor and adjacent tissue in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) diseases to help elucidate the mechanisms linking obesity with breast cancer biology in 519 post-menopausal women from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and NHSII. Methods: Differential gene expression was analyzed separately in ER+ and ER− disease both comparing overweight (BMI ≥ 25 to &lt; 30) or obese (BMI ≥ 30) women to women with normal BMI (BMI &lt; 25), and per 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI. Analyses controlled for age and year of diagnosis, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and hormone therapy use. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed and validated among a subset of post-menopausal cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (for tumor) and Polish Breast Cancer Study (for tumor-adjacent). Results: No gene was differentially expressed by BMI (FDR &lt; 0.05). BMI was significantly associated with increased cellular proliferation pathways, particularly in ER+ tumors, and increased inflammation pathways in ER− tumor and ER− tumor-adjacent tissues (FDR &lt; 0.05). High BMI was associated with upregulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ER+ tumor-adjacent tissues.

Several models have been developed to attempt to improve quality of care. Here, we describe characteristics and outcomes of patients who participated in survivorship visits (SV) at Johns Hopkins (JH). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of breast cancer patients who participated in an optional SV 1–3 months after completing locoregional therapy and initial systemic therapy. We report patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, treatments, and responses to symptom questionnaires. We compared the characteristics of SV participants to stage I–III analytical cases in the 2010–2015 JH Cancer Registry (JHCR). Results: We identified 87 women with stage I–III breast cancer who participated in SVs from 2010 to 2016. Compared to patients in the JHCR (n = 2942), SV participants were younger, more likely to be African American and more likely to have a higher TNM stage, hormone receptor-negative disease, and HER2-positive disease. They were more likely to have received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. They also have similar recurrence rates despite the SV cohort’s shorter median follow-up time. Among SV participants, the prevalence of comorbidities including peripheral neuropathy, anemia, lymphedema, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis, and depression increased significantly from time of diagnosis to most recent follow-up. Conclusions: Compared to the JHCR cohort, SV participants had higher risk cancers and a high frequency of comorbidities potentially associated with breast cancer and therapy. These high-risk patients may benefit most from specific interventions targeting survivorship care, and their experiences may help improve care delivery models. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056251890

Recent data suggest that pregnancy-induced tumor protection is different according to breast cancer subtypes, with parity and young age at first pregnancy being associated with a marked reduction in the risk of developing luminal subtype but not triple negative breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the imprint of parity and age at first pregnancy on the pattern of somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, transcriptomic profiles, and tumor immune microenvironment by assessing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) levels of subsequent breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 313 patients with primary breast cancer with available whole genome, RNA sequencing, and TILs data were included in this study. We used a multivariate analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis, pathological stage, molecular subtypes, and histological subtypes. We compared nulliparous vs. parous, late parous vs. early parous, and nulliparous vs. pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) patients. Late and early parous patients were grouped by using the median age at first pregnancy. PABC was defined as patients diagnosed up to 10 years postpartum. RESULTS: Genomic alterations of breast cancer were associated with age at first pregnancy but not with parity status alone. Independently of clinicopathological features, early parous patients developed tumors characterized by a higher number of Indels (Padj = 0.002), a lower frequency of CDH1 mutations (1.2% vs. 12.7%; Padj = 0.013), a higher frequency of TP53 mutations (50% vs. 22.5%; Padj = 0.010), and MYC amplification (28% vs. 7%; Padj = 0.008). PABC were associated with increased TILs infiltration (Padj = 0.0495). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight an unprecedented link between reproductive history and the genomic landscape of subsequent breast cancer. We further hypothesize that TP53-mutant premalignant lesions could be less susceptible to the protective effect of an early parity, which might explain the difference of parity-induced protection according to breast cancer subtypes. This work also advocates that reproductive history should be routinely collected in future large-scale genomic studies addressing the biology of female cancers.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061592455

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are reactive metabolites produced endogenously as a by-product of normal metabolism. A Western lifestyle also promotes AGE accumulation in the body which is associated with disease phenotypes through modification of the genome, protein crosslinking/dysfunction, and aberrant cell signaling. Given the links between lifestyle, AGEs, and disease, we examined the association between dietary-AGEs and breast cancer. Methods: We evaluated AGE levels in bio-specimens from estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancer patients, examined their role in therapy resistance, and assessed the ability of lifestyle intervention to reduce circulating AGE levels in ER+ breast cancer survivors. Results: An association between ER status and AGE levels was observed in tumor and serum samples. AGE treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells altered ERα phosphorylation and promoted resistance to tamoxifen therapy. In a proof of concept study, physical activity and dietary intervention was shown to be viable options for reducing circulating AGE levels in breast cancer survivors. Conclusions: There is a potential prognostic and therapeutic role for lifestyle derived AGEs in breast cancer. Given the potential benefits of lifestyle intervention on incidence and mortality, opportunities exist for the development of community health and nutritional programs aimed at reducing AGE exposure in order to improve breast cancer prevention and treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85055882137

Methods: Four hundred forty-four female Chinese patients following primary treatment for breast cancer completed a Chinese translation of the CSPro-BC. Participants were randomly divided into two equal groups (n = 222). The two samples were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and divergent and convergent validities were also determined. Results: The majority of participants were diagnosed with stage II or III breast cancer (76.1%), with a median of 16 months post-primary treatment, between the ages of 40–59, educated at the junior high school level or below (86.2%), married with children (93.7%), and unemployed (70.7%).

Stage was imputed for non-Hispanic (NH) white and NH black cases with missing information by distributing cases proportionally according to survival statistics. Results: During 2001–2015, incidence rates of early-onset metastatic breast cancer increased sharply among NH white, NH black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women. Increasing trends were also observed for local-stage disease (all racial/ethnic groups) and regional-stage disease (NH white and API). In contrast, rates decreased sharply for unstaged disease among all groups. After imputing stage for cases with missing information, the increasing trends for regional- and distant-stage disease in NH whites and local-stage disease in NH blacks were no longer statistically significant, but the increase in distant-stage disease in NH blacks was unchanged. Conclusions: After accounting for the sharp decline in unstaged cases, the increase in incidence rates for distant-stage disease became non-significant in NH whites but not in NH blacks. Future studies should consider accounting for temporal changes in unstaged disease when examining stage-specific incidence trends. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056628679

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess racial/ethnic disparities in survival among women diagnosed with IBC in the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program (MCSP) from 1998 to 2014. Methods: We examined the frequency and percentage of breast cancer cases coded to the various IBC codes in the MCSP registry over the study period. We used age-adjusted and multivariable Cox Proportional hazard regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of race/ethnicity with all-cause mortality. Results: Using a comprehensive case definition of IBC, 1324 IBC patients were identified from women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the MCSP [Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) = 227; Non-Hispanic White (NHW) = 984; Hispanic = 86; other = 27]. The percentage of all breast cancer cases defined as IBC in the MCSP registry differs considerably across registry codes from 0.02 to 1.1%. We observed significantly higher risk of death among NHB compared with NHW [HR (95% CI), 1.21 (1.01–1.45)], while no significant survival differences were observed between NHW and Hispanics or other racial/ethnic minorities. Conclusions: A comprehensive case definition should be utilized to avoid underestimation of IBC and to better understand this aggressive disease. Further research is needed to identify underlying causes and develop effective interventions to reduce IBC survival disparities between NHB and NHW women. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056326708

Disparities are commonly attributed to more advanced stage at presentation or aggressive tumor biology. We seek to evaluate if racial disparities persist in the treatment of stage 1 breast cancer patients who by definition are not delayed in presentation. Methods: We selected stage 1 breast cases in the National Cancer Data Base. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on race and included White and Black patients. We also performed a subgroup analysis of patients with private insurance for comparison to determine if private insurance diminished the racial disparities noted. We analyzed differences in time to treatments by race. Results: Our analysis included 546,351 patients of which 494,784 (90.6%) were White non-Hispanic and 51,567 (9.4%) were Black non-Hispanic. Black women had significantly longer times to first treatment (35.5 days vs 28.1 days), surgery (36.6 days vs 28.8 days), chemotherapy (88.1 days vs 75.4 days), radiation (131.3 days vs 99.1 days), and endocrine therapy (152.1 days vs 126.5 days) than White women. When patients with private insurance were analyzed the difference in time to surgery decreased by 1.2 days but racial differences remained statistically significant. Conclusions: Despite selecting for early-stage breast cancer, racial disparities between White and Black women in time to all forms of breast cancer treatment persist. These disparities while likely not oncologically significant do suggest institutional barriers for obtaining care faced by women of color which may not be addressed with improving access to mammography alone. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056093355

Although research typically has focused on fatigue that occurs during and after treatment, patients may experience fatigue even before treatment onset. The current study was designed to identify biobehavioral risk factors associated with fatigue before adjuvant therapy in women with early-stage breast cancer. Methods: Patients with stage 0 to stage IIIA breast cancer (270 women) were recruited before the onset of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or endocrine therapy. Host factors that may influence fatigue were identified from an empirically based, biobehavioral model and assessed using self-report questionnaires, medical record review, and blood collection (for genetic data). Fatigue was assessed by questionnaire. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between host factors and dimensions of fatigue, with general fatigue as the primary dimension of interest. Results: Fatigue was elevated at the pretreatment assessment compared with published controls. Bivariate analyses identified demographic, cancer-related, and biobehavioral correlates of fatigue. In the multivariable model, predictors of general fatigue included younger age, lower educational level, lower cancer stage, and history of childhood maltreatment (all P values <.05), with the full model accounting for approximately 18.4% of the variance in fatigue. Secondary analyses identified common and specific predictors of emotional, mental, and physical dimensions of fatigue. Conclusions: Among women who have not yet initiated treatment of breast cancer, demographic and psychosocial factors are associated with elevated fatigue and could be used to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. © 2018 American Cancer Society","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85058679584

This study was performed to assess the prevalence and effect of such transfers of care (TsOC) on the time to surgery, and its impact on current time-dependent breast cancer quality metrics at Commission on Cancer (CoC) and National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC)-accredited institutions. Methods: Patients having non-metastatic invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2015 at CoC and NAPBC centers (“reporting facilities”) in the National Cancer Database were reviewed. TsOC refer to transferring into or out of a reporting facility between diagnosis and surgery. Results: Among 622,793 patients, 36.6% of patients transferred care. TsOC add 7.3, 7.8, 8.7, and 9.8 days in time to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy, respectively (p’s < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, the odds of surgery occurring > 90 days from diagnosis were greatest for patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral mastectomy, Black or Hispanic patients, and those having TsOC (ORs > 1.73, p’s < 0.0001). TsOC increase the odds of non-compliance, per patient, for chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy time-dependent measures by 65.4%, 25.6%, and 56.5%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: TsOC for newly diagnosed breast cancers to or from an accredited facility result in delays in time to surgery which can affect compliance with time-dependent quality measures. Facilities frequently receiving transferred patients may be most adversely affected. Although non-compliance with these quality measures is low, institutions and accrediting bodies should be aware of these associations in order to comply with time-dependent standards. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056698831

Methods: Using the SEER-MHOS dataset, we identified women ≥ 65 years old with DCIS or stage I BC diagnosed 1998–2011 who completed surveys ≤ 24 months before diagnosis. Depressive symptoms were measured by major depressive disorder (MDD) risk and HRQOL was measured by Physical and Mental Component Summary scores (PCS and MCS, respectively) of the SF-36/VR-12. Associations with treatment choice (breast-conserving surgery [BCS] and radiation therapy [RT], BCS alone, mastectomy) were assessed with multivariable multinomial logistic regression, controlling for patient characteristics. Results: We identified 425 women with DCIS and 982 with stage I BC. Overall, 20.4% endorsed depressive symptoms placing them at risk for MDD pre-diagnosis; mean MCS and PCS scores were 52.3 (SD = 10.1) and 40.5 (SD = 11.5), respectively. Among women with DCIS, those at risk for MDD were more likely to receive BCS (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.04, 95% CI 1.04–4.00, p = 0.04) or mastectomy (AOR 1.88, 95% CI 0.91–3.86, p = 0.09) compared to BCS + RT.

Mcl-1 inhibitors, such as the BH3-mimetic EU-5346, therefore represent an exciting new class of targeting agents and are a current focus of widespread cancer-drug development efforts. Methods: ONCOMINE analysis was utilized to compare expression profiles of Bcl-2 family members across all major BC subgroups. Potential toxicities of EU-5346 were evaluated using iPS-generated cardiomyocytes, blood cells and astrocytes. The anti-BC cell activity of EU-5346-based therapies was evaluated using [ 3 H]-thymidine uptake and spheroid-forming assays as well as immunoblotting and the Chou-Talalay method. Protein level-based activity of EU-5346, the specific anti-Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and the specific anti-Bcl-x L inhibitor WEHI-539 was verified in Mcl-1 Δ/null versus Mcl-1 wt/wt MEFs. Results: We previously demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity of EU-5346 in all BC subtypes. Our present results go further and suggest that EU-5346 may induce limited adverse events such as cardiotoxicity, hematotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, frequently observed with other BH3 mimetics. As demonstrated by our mathematical scoring model, the prediction of EU-5643-induced IC 50 not only relies on the protein level of Mcl-1 but also on Bak, Bim, and Noxa. Synergistic anti-BC activity of low-dose EU-5346 with the BH3 mimetics ABT-199 or WEHI-539 was observed only in those BC cells expressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-x L , respectively. Similarly, when combined with tamoxifen or trastuzumab, low-dose EU-5346 induced significant anti-BC activity in hormone receptor positive or Her2-positive BC cells, respectively. Finally, EU-5346 in combination with paclitaxel induced synergistic anti-BC activity in both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant TNBC cells. Conclusion: These data strongly support the further clinical development of EU-5346 to improve BC patient survival. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055982251

Methods: Between recruitment in 1993–1996 and 2013, 7570 incident BC cases were identified through SEER cancer registries in Hawaii and California. T2D diagnosed before BC was ascertained in 1013 women from self-reports and confirmed by administrative data sources. Covariate information was collected by questionnaire. Cox regression analysis with age as the time metric and BMI as time-varying exposure was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for BC-specific and all-cause survival while adjusting for known prognostic factors. Results: In total, 2119 all-cause and 730 BC-specific deaths were recorded with corresponding 5-year survival rates of 86 and 93%. T2D was not a significant predictor of BC-specific survival (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.65–1.09), but mortality was 36% lower for those with &lt; 7 years of T2D than a longer history of T2D. On the other hand, all-cause mortality was higher in women with T2D (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.08–1.40), especially in women with T2D of ≥ 7 years duration (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.07–1.49). In women receiving none or either chemotherapy or radiation but not both, T2D predicted higher all-cause mortality (P interaction = 0.004). Variations in the association of T2D with mortality across ethnic groups were small. Conclusions: T2D was associated with higher all-cause but not BC-specific mortality among women with BC in the Multiethnic Cohort study.

Here we identify Six2, a developmental transcription factor, as a critical regulator of a breast cancer stem cell program that enables metastatic colonization. In several triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models, Six2 enhanced the expression of genes associated with embryonic stem cell programs. Six2 directly bound the Sox2 Srr2 enhancer, promoting Sox2 expression and downstream expression of Nanog, which are both key pluripotency factors. Regulation of Sox2 by Six2 enhanced cancer stem cell properties and increased metastatic colonization. Six2 and Sox2 expression correlated highly in breast cancers including TNBC, where a Six2 expression signature was predictive of metastatic burden and poor clinical outcome.

The impact of dense breast notifications (DBNs) on women with limited English proficiency (LEP) is unknown. Objective: This study sought to understand Spanish-speaking women’s experience receiving DBNs in a Massachusetts safety-net hospital. Design: Eligible women completed one audio-recorded, semi-structured interview via telephone with a native Spanish-speaking research assistant trained in qualitative methods. Interviews were professionally transcribed verbatim and translated. The translation was verified by a third reviewer to ensure fidelity with audio recordings. Participants: Nineteen Spanish-speaking women ages 40–74 who received mammography with a normal result and recalled receiving a DBN. Approach: Using the verified English transcripts, we conducted a content analysis to identify women’s perceptions and actions related to receiving the notification. A structured codebook was developed. Transcripts were independently coded and assessed for agreement with a modification of Cohen’s kappa. Content codes were grouped to build themes related to women’s perceptions and actions after receiving a DBN. Key Results: Nineteen Spanish-speaking women completed interviews. Nine reported not receiving the notification in their native language. Four key themes emerged: (1) The novelty of breast density contributed to notification-induced confusion; (2) women misinterpreted key messages in the notification; (3) varied actions were taken to seek further information; and (4) women held unrealized expectations and preferences for follow-up. Conclusions: Not having previous knowledge of breast density and receiving notifications in English contributed to confusion about its meaning and inaccurate interpretations of key messages by Spanish speakers. Tools that promote understanding should be leveraged in seeking equity in risk-based breast cancer screening for women with dense breasts. © 2018, Society of General Internal Medicine.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055685536

However, while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures of progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset of ERα-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (control, 10% kcal from fat) or control diet + SDG (SDG, 100 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks, then orthotopically injected with syngeneic E0771 mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growth was monitored for 3 weeks. The role of reduced NF-κB signaling in SDG’s anti-tumor effects was explored in vitro via treatment with the bioactive SDG metabolite ENL. In addition to the murine E0771 cells, the in vitro studies utilized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, two human cell lines which model the triple-negative and luminal A breast cancer subtypes, respectively. Results: SDG supplementation in the mice significantly reduced tumor volume and expression of phospho-p65 and NF-κB target genes (P < 0.05). Markers of macrophage infiltration were decreased in the distal-to-tumor mammary fat pad of mice supplemented with SDG relative to control mice (P < 0.05). In vitro, ENL treatment inhibited viability, survival, and NF-κB activity and target gene expression in E0771, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Overexpression of Rela attenuated ENL’s inhibition of E0771 cell viability and survival. Conclusions: SDG reduces tumor growth in the E0771 model of TNBC, likely via a mechanism involving inhibition of NF-κB activity. SDG could serve as a practical and effective adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence, but greater understanding of its effects is needed to inform the development of more targeted recommendations for its use. © 2018, The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85055701548

We hypothesized CEE alone induces estrogen hydroxylation along the 2-pathway rather than the competing 16-pathway, a pattern linked to reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. One thousand eight hundred and sixty-four women in a WHIOS case–control study of estrogen metabolism and ovarian and endometrial cancer were studied of whom 609 were current E + P users (351 used CEE + MPA), while 272 used E alone (162 used CEE). Fifteen EM were measured, and analyses were conducted for each metabolite, hydroxylation pathway (2-, 4-, or 16-pathway) and ratios of pathway concentrations using inverse probability weighted linear regression. Compared to E + P users, all EM were higher in E alone users (significant for unconjugated estrone, total/conjugated estradiol, total/unconjugated 2-methoxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone and unconjugated estriol). The relative concentrations of 2- and 4-pathway EM did not differ between the MHT users (2-pathway EM comprised 15% and 4-pathway EM <2% of the total), but 16-pathway EM were lower in E alone users (p = 0.036). Ratios of 2- and 4-pathway EM compared to 16-pathway EM were significantly higher in E alone compared to E + P users. Similar but not significant patterns were observed in CEE-alone and CEE + MPA users. Our data suggest that compared to E + P users, women using E alone have more extensive metabolism via the 2- vs. the competing 16-pathway. This is consistent with epidemiologic evidence of reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk associated with this metabolic profile and may provide a clue to the breast cancer risk reduction in CEE alone users during the WHI.

Its role in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) has not been established. Methods: The National Cancer Database was used to identify all patients with T1–T3, ER-positive, HER2-negative primary invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 who had Oncotype DX recurrence scores (RS) and received NCT. RS were classified as low, intermediate, or high. Unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses were performed to determine the association between pathologic complete response (pCR) and RS. Results: A total of 989 patients (mean age, 54.6 years) with available RS who underwent NCT were identified. RS were low in 227 (23.0%) patients, intermediate in 450 (45.5%) patients, and high in 312 (31.5%) patients. Most patients had a T1 (431 [43.6%]) or T2 tumor (451 [45.6%]). Most had N0 disease (757 [76.5%]). Tumor grades were 1 (123 [12.4%]), 2 (517 [52.3%]), or 3 (349 [35.3%]). pCR was achieved by 42 (4.3%) patients. Adjusted multivariable analysis showed a significant association between pCR and high RS (odds ratio 4.87; 95% confidence interval 2.01–11.82). Conclusions: High Oncotype DX RS was associated with pCR after NCT in this national cohort of ER-positive, HER2-negative patients.

In this study, we investigated whether the pre-NAC axillary lymph node status influences the number of SLNs identified. Methods: Stage I–III breast cancer patients who received NAC and underwent SLNB from May 2014 to April 2016 were identified from an institutional prospective database. Clinical and pathological factors among clinically node-negative (cN−) and clinically node-positive (cN+) patients who converted to cN− post-NAC were compared. Generalized linear mixed models analyzed factors associated with the number of SLNs removed. Results: Among 343 patients who underwent SLNB during the study period, 335 (98%) had at least one SLN identified, and subsequently comprised the study population. The median number of SLNs identified was 4 (range 1–14), which did not differ according to pre-NAC nodal status (P = 0.15).

Conclusions: Our study confirms that SLNB was successfully performed in 98% of our patients after NAC, with very few failed mapping procedures.

It is unknown whether individual foci with similar histology also share molecular and biological similarities or are heterogenous. This study examined the concordance of the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) in multiple synchronous morphologically similar ipsilateral BCs. Patients and Methods: We identified patients with multiple ipsilateral BCs and available RS treated at our institution from 1/2014 to 6/2018. BCs were divided into three groups based on RS: (1) RS in same risk category, (2) RS in different risk categories but within 2-unit difference (e.g., RS 17 and RS 19), and (3) RS in different risk categories and a change of > 2 units. BCs in groups 1 and 2 were considered as concordant (no significant clinical impact) and BCs in group 3 as discordant (variation affects management). Results: A total of 53 patients met the study criteria. RS was concordant in 46 (87%) cases. Seven (13%) cases were discordant (group 3). Of these, three (43%, 3/7) had biopsy cavity changes (BXC) adjacent to the BC with highest RS. In two cases the focus with higher RS had a lower percentage of progesterone receptor-positive tumor cells. In two cases, extensive ductal carcinoma in situ was associated with the BC focus with lower RS. Conclusions: Morphologically similar multifocal ipsilateral BCs have concordant RS in 87% (46/53) of cases.

Methods: Using the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2004-2015), the authors examined the characteristics, overall and cause-specific survival, and cumulative incidence function of cancer-related death among patients with myeloma with secondary cancers of the breast, prostate, lung, colon/rectum, or bladder or melanoma. Each patient was matched based on age, sex, race, and year of diagnosis to 50 controls from a general population who were diagnosed with the index cancer. Results: Patients with myeloma with breast, prostate, or lung cancer were more commonly diagnosed at an early stage, whereas the stage distribution did not differ significantly among patients with melanoma, colorectal cancer, or bladder cancer. For all studied cancers except those of the lung, overall mortality was significantly higher among patients with myeloma compared with controls (hazard ratios, 1.84-2.81). However, the cumulative incidence function of cancer-related death did not differ (subhazard ratios, 0.84-0.99) and was surpassed by myeloma-related deaths (23% to 35% at 5 years). In patients with lung cancer, cancer-related mortality was uniquely lower among patients with myeloma (subhazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.68), even after adjustment for stage of disease. There was no significant difference noted with regard to noncancer deaths for any studied solid tumor. Use of surgery (evaluated in patients with nonmetastatic tumors, and in addition matched by disease stage) did not differ between cases and controls, except for fewer prostatectomies being noted among patients with myeloma (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.74).

Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics with whether the woman was over-, under-, or appropriately tested for BRCA1/2 mutations, per 2015 NCCN guidelines. Results: 3894 women (18.8%) reported BRCA1/2 testing. 5628 (27.1%) women who met NCCN criteria for testing were not tested. Among women with a history of breast cancer, those without health insurance were more likely to be under-tested (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.15–3.60) than those with managed care insurance, and higher education was associated with a lower likelihood of under-testing (Graduate/professional degree OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55–0.91). Conclusion: Almost 30% of women were under-tested, indicating that many high-risk women who may benefit from genetic testing are currently being missed. Without appropriate testing, providers are unable to tailor screening recommendations to those carrying mutations who are at highest risk.

The association between sepsis and subsequent risk of cancer is poorly understood. Methods Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, we conducted a case-control study in US adults. We included 1801156 cases with a first cancer diagnosis in SEER during 1992-2013 (ages 66-115 years) and 200000 cancer-free controls from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Sepsis was identified using inpatient Medicare claims. Associations with sepsis were estimated using logistic regression. Results After correction for multiple comparisons, sepsis was significantly associated with increased risk for cancers of the colon (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.12), rectum (1.13), liver (1.47), lung (1.17), and cervix (1.52), as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 1.19), chronic myeloid leukemia (1.54), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.30). Inverse associations were observed for cancers of the breast (aOR = 0.86), prostate (0.75), kidney (0.90), and thyroid (0.68) and for melanoma (0.83), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (0.89), and follicular lymphoma (0.65). Sepsis was significantly associated with the following 9 types of cancer in the period >5 years following sepsis diagnosis: Thyroid, prostate, colon, rectum, lung, and liver and follicular lymphoma, melanoma, and AML. Conclusions Sepsis is associated with increased or decreased risks for a small group of cancers. Factors that may explain these associations include etiologic effects.

Screening mammography is effective in reducing mortality, but has a high rate of unnecessary recalls and biopsies. While deep learning can be applied to mammography, large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain, are required. We aim to remove many barriers of dataset development by automatically harvesting data from existing clinical records using a hybrid framework combining traditional NLP and IBM Watson. An expert reviewer manually annotated 3521 breast pathology reports with one of four outcomes: left positive, right positive, bilateral positive, negative. Traditional NLP techniques using seven different machine learning classifiers were compared to IBM Watson’s automated natural language classifier. Techniques were evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. Logistic regression outperformed all other traditional machine learning classifiers and was used for subsequent comparisons. Both traditional NLP and Watson’s NLC performed well for cases under 1024 characters with weighted average F-measures above 0.96 across all classes. Performance of traditional NLP was lower for cases over 1024 characters with an F-measure of 0.83. We demonstrate a hybrid framework using traditional NLP techniques combined with IBM Watson to annotate over 10,000 breast pathology reports for development of a large-scale database to be used for deep learning in mammography. Our work shows that traditional NLP and IBM Watson perform extremely well for cases under 1024 characters and can accelerate the rate of data annotation. © 2018, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","Final",,2-s2.0-85052536047

To ensure therapeutic efficacy of PARPi against HCC, a disease often diagnosed at intermediate to advanced stages with no effective treatment options, it is critical to identify not only biomarkers to predict PARPi resistance but also rational treatments to overcome this. Here, we report that a heterodimer of EGFR and MET interacts with and phosphorylates Y907 of PARP1 in the nucleus, which contributes to PARPi resistance. Inhibition of both EGFR and MET sensitized HCC cells to PARPi, and both EGFR and MET are known to be overexpressed in HCC. This report provides an explanation for the poor efficacy of PARPi against HCC and suggests combinatorial treatment consisting of EGFR, MET, and PARP inhibitors may be an effective therapeutic strategy in HCC. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061577324

Endocrine therapy (ET) for LCIS has been shown to decrease breast cancer risk substantially. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the trends of ET use for LCIS in two large geographic locations. Patients and methods: We identified women, ages 18 through 75, with a microscopic diagnosis of LCIS in California (CA) and New Jersey (NJ) from 2004 to 2014. We evaluated trends in unadjusted ET rates during the study period and used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, and ET use. Results: We identified 3,129 patients in CA and 2,965 patients in NJ. The overall use of ET during the study period was 14%. For the combined sample, women in NJ were significantly less likely to utilize ET then their counterparts in CA (OR 0.77, CI 0.66–0.90, NJ vs. CA). In addition, patients in the later year period (OR 1.27, CI 1.01–1.59, 2012–2014 vs. 2004–2005) and women who received an excisional biopsy (OR 2.35, CI 1.74–3.17), were more likely to utilize ET. Uninsured women were less likely to receive ET (OR 0.61, CI 0.44–0.84, non-insured vs. insured status). Conclusions: We observed that an increasing proportion of women are using ET for LCIS management, but geographical differences exist. Health insurance status played an important role in the underutilization of ET.

In pediatric malignancies, however, with simple tumor genomes and infrequent targetable mutations, there have been few new FDA-approved targeted drugs. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 pathway recently emerged as a dependency in Ewing sarcoma. Given the heightened efficacy of this class with targeted drug combinations in other cancers, as well as the propensity of resistance to emerge with single agents, we aimed to identify genes mediating resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and biologically relevant combinations for use with CDK4/6 inhibitors in Ewing. Experimental Design: We performed a genome-scale open reading frame (ORF) screen in 2 Ewing cell lines sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors to identify genes conferring resistance. Concurrently, we established resistance to a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a Ewing cell line. Results: The ORF screen revealed IGF1R as a gene whose overexpression promoted drug escape. We also found elevated levels of phospho-IGF1R in our resistant Ewing cell line, supporting the relevance of IGF1R signaling to acquired resistance. In a small-molecule screen, an IGF1R inhibitor scored as synergistic with CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and IGF1R inhibitors was synergistic in vitro and active in mouse models. Mechanistically, this combination more profoundly repressed cell cycle and PI3K/mTOR signaling than either single drug perturbation. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that IGF1R inhibitors activation is an escape mechanism to CDK4/6 inhibitors in Ewing sarcoma and that dual targeting of CDK4/6 inhibitors and IGF1R inhibitors provides a candidate synergistic combination for clinical application in this disease. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061610334

Objectives To analyze the impact ADM plays on clinical outcomes on immediate tissue expander (ITE) reconstruction undergoing PMRT. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ITE breast reconstruction from 2004 to 2014 at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients were categorized into four cohorts: ADM, ADM with PMRT, non-ADM, and non-ADM with PMRT. Outcomes and complications were compared among cohorts. Results Over 10 years, 957 patients underwent ITE reconstruction (683 non-ADM, 113 non-ADM with PMRT, 486 ADM, and 88 ADM with PMRT) with 1370 reconstructions. Overall complication rates for the ADM and non-ADM cohorts were 39.0% and 16.7%, respectively (P < 0.001). Within both cohorts, mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) was the most common complication, followed by infection. ADM use was associated with a significantly higher rate of infections and seromas in both radiated and non-radiated groups; however, when comparing radiated cohorts, the incidence of explantation was significantly lower with the use of ADM. Conclusions The decision to use ADM for expander-based breast reconstruction should be performed with caution, given higher overall rates of complications, including infections and seromas. There may, however, be a role for ADM in cases requiring PMRT, as the overall incidence of implant failure is lower than non-ADM cases.

The objective was to examine the stability and pharmacokinetics of [ 68 Ga]NODAGA and DOTA-peptide conjugate targeting VPAC [combined for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)] receptors on tumor cells. Procedures: A VPAC receptor-specific peptide was chosen as a model peptide and conjugated to NODAGA and DOTA via solid-phase synthesis. The conjugates were characterized by HPLC and MALDI-TOF. Following Ga-68 chelation, the radiochemical purity of Ga-68 labeled peptide conjugate was determined by radio-HPLC. The stability was tested against transmetallation using 100 nM Fe 3+ /Zn 2+ /Ca 2+ ionic solution and against transchelation using 200 μM DTPA solution. The ex vivo and in vivo stability of the Ga-68 labeled peptide conjugate was tested in mouse plasma and urine. Receptor specificity was determined ex vivo by cell binding assays using human breast cancer BT474 cells. Positron emission tomography (PET)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, tissue distribution, and blocking studies were performed in mice bearing BT474 xenografts. Results: The chemical and radiochemical purity was greater than 95 % and both conjugates were stable against transchelation and transmetallation. Ex vivo stability at 60 min showed that the NODAGA-peptide-bound Ga-68 reduced to 42.1 ± 3.7 % (in plasma) and 37.4 ± 2.9 % (in urine), whereas the DOTA-peptide-bound Ga-68 was reduced to 1.2 ± 0.3 % (in plasma) and 4.2 ± 0.4 % (in urine) at 60 min. Similarly, the in vivo stability for [ 68 Ga]NODAGA-peptide was decreased to 2.1 ± 0.2 % (in plasma) and 2.2 ± 0.4 % (in urine). For [ 68 Ga]DOTA-peptide, it was decreased to 1.4 ± 0.3 % (in plasma) and 1.2 ± 0.4 % (in urine) at 60 min. The specific BT474 cell binding was 53.9 ± 0.8 % for [ 68 Ga]NODAGA-peptide, 25.8 ± 1.4 % for [ 68 Ga]-DOTA-peptide, and 18.8 ± 2.5 % for [ 68 Ga]GaCl 3 at 60 min. Inveon microPET/CT imaging at 1 h post-injection showed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher tumor to muscle (T/M) ratio for [ 68 Ga]NODAGA-peptide (3.4 ± 0.3) as compared to [ 68 Ga]DOTA-peptide (1.8 ± 0.6). For [ 68 Ga]GaCl 3 and blocked mice, their ratios were 1.5 ± 0.6 and 1.5 ± 0.3 respectively. The tissue distributions data were similar to the PET imaging data. Conclusion: NODAGA is superior to DOTA in terms of radiolabeling kinetics. The method of radiolabeling was reproducible and yielded higher specific activity. Although both agents have relatively low in vivo stability, PET/CT imaging studies delineated BC tumors with [ 68 Ga]NODAGA-peptide, but not with [ 68 Ga]DOTA-peptide. © 2018, World Molecular Imaging Society.","Final",,2-s2.0-85047396187

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate of trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent emtansine (DM1), a maytansine derivative and microtubule inhibitor, provides benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer that was previously treated with chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy. METHODS We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial involving patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were found to have residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy containing a taxane (with or without anthracycline) and trastuzumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause). RESULTS At the interim analysis, among 1486 randomly assigned patients (743 in the T-DM1 group and 743 in the trastuzumab group), invasive disease or death had occurred in 91 patients in the T-DM1 group (12.2%) and 165 patients in the trastuzumab group (22.2%). The estimated percentage of patients who were free of invasive disease at 3 years was 88.3% in the T-DM1 group and 77.0% in the trastuzumab group. Invasive disease-free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001). Distant recurrence as the first invasive-disease event occurred in 10.5% of patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.9% of those in the trastuzumab group. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of T-DM1, with more adverse events associated with T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who had residual invasive disease after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the risk of recurrence of invasive breast cancer or death was 50% lower with adjuvant T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone. © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059540229

HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is deregulated in diverse cancers and could be an independent and powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Yet, it is challenging to develop small molecule drugs to block activity of HOTAIR with high specificity in a short time. Results: Our previous study proved that the 5′ domain, but not its 3′ domain, was the function domain of HOTAIR responsible for tumorigenesis and metastasis in glioblastoma and breast cancer, by recruiting and binding EZH2. Here, we targeted to establish a structure-based methodology to identify lead compounds of HOTAIR, by abrogating scaffold interactions with EZH2. And a small compound AC1NOD4Q (ADQ) was identified by high-throughput molecular docking-based virtual screening of the PubChem library. Our analysis revealed that ADQ was sufficiently and specifically interfering HOTAIR/EZH2 interaction, thereby impairing the H3K27-mediated tri-methylation of NLK, the target of HOTAIR gene, and consequently inhibiting tumor metastasis through Wnt/β-catenin pathway in vitro and in orthotopic breast cancer models.

Identifying associations between environmental exposures and density may elucidate relationships with breast cancer. Metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may influence breast density via oxidative stress or endocrine disruption. Methods: Study participants (n = 222,581) underwent a screening mammogram in 2011 at a radiology facility in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Zip code residential levels of airborne PAHs and metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium) were assessed using the 2011 EPA National Air Toxics Assessment. Breast density was measured using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the individual air toxics and dense breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4). Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was used to model the association between the air toxic mixture and density. Results: Higher residential levels of arsenic, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, or PAHs were individually associated with breast density. Comparing the highest to the lowest quartile, higher odds of having dense breasts were observed for cobalt (OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.56-1.64) and lead (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.52-1.64). Associations were stronger for premenopausal women. The WQS index was associated with density overall (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.20-1.24); the most heavily weighted air toxics were lead and cobalt. Conclusions: In this first study to evaluate the association between air toxics and breast density, women living in areas with higher concentrations of lead and cobalt were more likely to have dense breasts. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061556338

As most patients in this setting have already developed mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy, targeting biological pathways associated with endocrine resistance in combination with fulvestrant may improve outcomes. Therefore, evidence supporting a combinatorial treatment approach in the second-line setting was investigated based on a search of PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. Twenty-eight studies of targeted therapies plus fulvestrant as second-line treatment for HR+ ABC were identified, including three and six key randomized trials exploring cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors plus fulvestrant respectively. Additional combinations with fulvestrant included inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors, androgen receptor, and the bromodomain and extra-terminal family of proteins. Across the studies reviewed with available data, the addition of targeted therapies to fulvestrant resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival compared with fulvestrant alone. While some challenging toxicities were observed, most adverse events could be effectively managed. Selection of second-line targeted therapy for use with fulvestrant should consider prior treatment as well as the mutation status of the tumor. In conclusion, available data indicate that fulvestrant combined with agents targeting mechanisms of endocrine resistance is a promising approach. The ongoing trials identified in this review will help further inform the selection of combination treatments with fulvestrant for HR+ ABC. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85052629577

However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are poorly defined. Using a murine breast tumor line, we showed that MHCII-expressing tumors grew more slowly than controls and recruited more functional CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. In addition, MHCII-expressing tumors contained more TCR clonotypes expanded to a larger degree than control tumors. Functional CD8 + T cells in tumors depended on CD4 + T cells. However, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells eventually became exhausted, even in MHCII-expressing tumors. Treatment with anti-CTLA4, but not anti-PD-1 or anti-TIM-3, promoted complete eradication of MHCII-expressing tumors. These results suggest tumor cell expression of MHCII facilitates the local activation of CD4 + T cells, indirectly helps the activation and expansion of CD8 + T cells, and, in combination with the appropriate checkpoint inhibitor, promotes tumor regression. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055411059

We hypothesized that modified platelets lacking their aggregation and activation capacity could act as reversible inhibitors of platelet activation cascades. Here, we describe the development of detergent-extracted human modified platelets (platelet decoys) that retained platelet binding functions but were incapable of functional activation and aggregation. Platelet decoys inhibited aggregation and adhesion of platelets on thrombogenic surfaces in vitro, which could be immediately reversed by the addition of normal platelets; in vivo in a rabbit model, pretreatment with platelet decoys inhibited arterial injury-induced thromboembolism. Decoys also interfered with platelet-mediated human breast cancer cell aggregation, and their presence decreased cancer cell arrest and extravasation in a microfluidic human microvasculature on a chip. In a mouse model of metastasis, simultaneous injection of the platelet decoys with tumor cells inhibited metastatic tumor growth. Thus, our results suggest that platelet decoys might represent an effective strategy for obtaining antithrombotic and antimetastatic effects.

Furthermore, the role of the male head of household in influencing a woman's breast health seeking behavior is also not known. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, perceptions and practice of breast cancer among women, male heads of households, opinion leaders and healthcare providers within a rural community in Kenya. Our secondary objective was to explore the role of male heads of households in influencing a woman's breast health seeking behavior. METHODS: This was a mixed method cross-sectional study, conducted between Sept 1st 2015 Sept 30th 2016. We administered surveys to women and male heads of households. Outcomes of interest were analysed in Stata ver 13 and tabulated against gender. We conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) and 22 key informant interviews (KIIs) with opinion leaders and health care providers, respectively. Elements of the Rapid Assessment Process (RAP) were used to guide analysis of the FGDs and the KIIs. RESULTS: A total of 442 women and 237 male heads of households participated in the survey. Although more than 80% of respondents had heard of breast cancer, fewer than 10% of women and male heads of households had knowledge of 2 or more of its risk factors. More than 85% of both men and women perceived breast cancer as a very serious illness. Over 90% of respondents would visit a health facility for a breast lump. Variable recognition of signs of breast cancer, limited decision- autonomy for women, a preference for traditional healers, lack of trust in the health care system, inadequate access to services, limited early-detection services were the six themes that emerged from the FGDs and the KIIs. There were discrepancies between the qualitative and quantitative data for the perceived role of the male head of household as a barrier to seeking breast health care. CONCLUSIONS: Determining level of breast cancer knowledge, the characteristics of breast health seeking behavior and the perceived barriers to accessing breast health are the first steps in establishing locally relevant intervention programs.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061515682

The compounds employed were required to elicit a sensitive response (vs. resistance) in more than half of the cell lines tested for each cancer. Methodological approaches included peptide sequence alignments and homology modeling for 3D protein structure determination, ligand preparation, docking, toxicity and ADME prediction. Docking was performed for unique lists of DNA repair proteins which predict OS for AML, cancers of the breast, lung, colon, and ovaries, GBM, melanoma, and renal papillary cancer. Results indicate hundreds of drug-like and lead-like ligands with best-pose binding energies less than −6 kcal/mol. Ligand solubility for the top 20 drug-like hits approached lower bounds, while lipophilicity was acceptable. Most ligands were also blood-brain barrier permeable with high intestinal absorption rates. While the majority of ligands lacked positive prediction for HERG channel blockage and Ames carcinogenicity, there was a considerable variation for predicted fathead minnow, honey bee, and Tetrahymena pyriformis toxicity.

But the expression profile and function of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are unclear. Methods: We used a circRNA microarray to explore the circRNA expression profile of TNBC. The expression of the top upregulated circRNA, circKIF4A, was confirmed by qRT-PCR in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to analyze the clinical impact of circKIF4A on TNBC. A series of experiments was performed to explore the functions of circKIF4A in TNBC progression, such as cell proliferation and migration. We investigated the regulatory effect of circKIF4A on miRNA and its target genes to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms of circKIF4A in TNBC. Results: qRT-PCR analyses verified that circKIF4A was significantly upregulated and positively associated with poorer survival of TNBC. The inhibition of circKIF4A suppressed cell proliferation and migration in TNBC. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay revealed that circKIF4A and KIF4A could bind to miR-375 and that circKIF4A regulated the expression of KIF4A via sponging miR-375. Conclusions: The circKIF4A-miR-375-KIF4A axis regulates TNBC progression via the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. circKIF4A may therefore serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for TNBC. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061394918

Although gene expression profiling has led to the definition of several subtypes of breast cancer, the precise discovery of the subtypes remains a challenge. Clinical data is another promising source. In this study, clinical variables are utilized and integrated to gene expressions for the stratification of breast cancer. We adopt two phases: gene selection and clustering, where the integration is in the gene selection phase; only genes whose expressions are most relevant to each clinical variable and least redundant among themselves are selected for further clustering. In practice, we simply utilize maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) for gene selection and k-means for clustering. We compare the results of our method with those of two commonly used only expression-based breast cancer stratification methods: prediction analysis of microarray 50 (PAM50) and highest variability (HV). The result is that our method outperforms them in identifying subtypes significantly associated with five-year survival and recurrence time. Specifically, our method identified recurrence-associated breast cancer subtypes that were not identified by PAM50 and HV. Additionally, our analysis discovered three survival-associated luminal-A subgroups and two survival-associated luminal-B subgroups.

We first applied multiscale bilateral filtering to the reconstructed DBT slices to enhance the high-frequency features and reduce noise. A maximum intensity projection (MIP) image was then obtained from the high-frequency components of the DBT slices. A multiscale image fusion method was designed to combine the MIP image and the central DBT projection view into an SM and further enhance the high-frequency features. We conducted a pilot reader study to visually assess the image quality of SM in comparison to full field digital mammograms (FFDM). For each DBT craniocaudal or mediolateral view, a clinical FFDM of the corresponding view was retrospectively collected. Three MQSA radiologists, blinded to the pathological and other clinical information, independently interpreted the SM and the corresponding FFDM side by side marked with the lesion locations. The differences in the BI-RADS assessments of both MCs and masses between SM and FFDM did not achieve statistical significance for all three readers. The conspicuity of MCs on SM was superior to that on FFDM and the BI-RADS assessments of MCs were comparable while the conspicuity of masses on SM was degraded and interpretation on SM was less accurate than that on FFDM. The SM may be useful for efficient prescreening of MCs in DBT but the DBT should be used for detection and characterization of masses. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061225566

The specific degradation of nuclear components by the autophagy pathway is called nucleophagy. Most studies have focused on autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic materials, and little is known about the role of autophagy in the degradation of nuclear components. Methods: Human MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines were used as model systems in vitro. Induction of nucleophagy by nuclear DNA leakage was determined by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. The interaction and colocalization of LC3 and lamin A/C was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. The role of the SUMO E2 ligase, UBC9, on the regulation of SUMOylation of lamin A/C and nucleophagy was determined by siRNA silencing of UBC9, and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Results: DNA damage induced nuclear accumulation of UBC9 ligase which resulted in SUMOylation of lamin A/C and that SUMOylation of this protein was required for the interaction between the autophagy protein LC3 and lamin A/C, which was required for nucleophagy. Knockdown of UBC9 prevented SUMOylation of lamin A/C and LC3-lamin A/C interaction. This attenuated nucleophagy which degraded nuclear components lamin A/C and leaked nuclear DNA mediated by DNA damage. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nuclear DNA leakage activates nucleophagy through UBC9-mediated SUMOylation of lamin A/C, leading to degradation of nuclear components including lamin A/C and leaked nuclear DNA. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061375137

Methods: We developed a conceptual framework and empirical tool that separates unmet need from met need and subcategorizes the causes of unmet need into suboptimal access to and ineffective use of current technologies and lack of current technologies. Statistical models were used to model the relationship between health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and treatment utilization using data from the National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS). Predicted HR-QOL was combined with prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to estimate met need and the causes of unmet need due to morbidity in the US and EU5 for five diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, hepatitis C, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: HR-QOL was positively correlated with adherence to medication and patient-perceived quality and negatively correlated with financial barriers. Met need was substantial across all disease and regions, although significant unmet need remains. While the majority of unmet need was driven by lack of technologies rather than ineffective use of current technologies, there was considerable variation across diseases and regions. Overall unmet need was largest for COPD, which had the highest prevalence of all diseases in this study. Conclusion: We developed a methodology that can inform decisions about which diseases to invest in and whether those investments should focus on improving access to currently available technologies or inventing new technologies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061350928

The general multiple mediation analysis method, proposed by Yu et al, improves traditional methods (eg, estimation of natural and controlled direct effects) to enable consideration of multiple mediators/confounders simultaneously and the use of linear and nonlinear predictive models for estimating mediation/confounding effects. In this paper, we extend the method for time-to-event outcomes and apply the method to explore the racial disparity in breast cancer survivals. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women of all races. Despite improvement of survival rates of breast cancer in the US, a significant difference between white and black women remains. Previous studies have found that more advanced and aggressive tumors and less than optimal treatment may explain the lower survival rates for black women as compared to white women. Due to limitations of current analytic methods and the lack of comprehensive data sets, researchers have not been able to differentiate the relative effect each factor contributes to the overall racial disparity. We use the CDC-funded Patterns of Care study to examine the determinants of racial disparities in breast cancer survival using a novel multiple mediation analysis. Using the proposed method, we applied the Cox hazard model and multiple additive regression trees as predictive models and found that all racial disparity in survival among Louisiana breast cancer patients were explained by factors included in the study. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053799675

METHODS ASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018. Guideline recommendations were based on the Panel’s review of the evidence from six trials. RESULTS The six included studies of AI treatment beyond 5 years of therapy demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo. Bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment. RECOMMENDATIONS The Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk of reduction were modest and that, for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration that is based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for decisions about extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, including discussions about the absolute benefits in the reduction of breast cancer recurrence, the prevention of second breast cancers, and the impact of adverse effects of treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Premenopausal women with stage cT2 to 4b, any N, M0; estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor greater than 50%; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to triptorelin 3.75 mg administered intramuscularly on day 1 of every cycle or degarelix 240 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of cycle 1 then 80 mg SC on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6, both with letrozole 2.5 mg/day for six 28-day cycles. Surgery was performed 2 to 3 weeks after the last injection. Serum was collected at baseline, after 24 and 72 hours, at 7 and 14 days, and then before injections on cycles 2 through 6. The primary end point was time to optimal OFS (time from the first injection to first assessment of centrally assessed estradiol level # 2.72 pg/mL [# 10 pmol/L] during neoadjuvant therapy). The trial had 90% power to detect a difference using a log-rank test with a two-sided a of .05. Secondary end points included response, tolerability, and patient-reported endocrine symptoms. RESULTS Between February 2014 and January 2017, 51 patients were enrolled (n = 26 received triptorelin plus letrozole; n = 25 received degarelix plus letrozole). Time to optimal OFS was three times faster for patients assigned to degarelix and letrozole than to triptorelin and letrozole (median, 3 v 14 days; hazard ratio, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.65 to 5.65; P, .001). Furthermore, OFS was maintained during subsequent cycles for all patients assigned to receive degarelix and letrozole, whereas 15.4% of patients assigned to receive triptorelin and letrozole had suboptimal OFS after cycle 1 (six events during 127 measurements). Adverse events as a result of both degarelix plus letrozole and triptorelin plus letrozole were as expected. CONCLUSION In premenopausal women receiving letrozole for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, OFS was achieved more quickly and maintained more effectively with degarelix than with triptorelin. © 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

To calculate an appropriate sample size to detect a survival difference based upon pCR data, it is necessary to relate the effect size in pCR with the effect size in survival. Here, we propose an exponential mixture model for survival time with parameters for the neoadjuvant pCR rates and an estimated benefit of achieving pCR to determine the treatment effect size. Through simulation studies, we demonstrated how to estimate the empirical power for detecting the survival efficacy under a parameter setting. We also showed a more efficient way to estimate the power for detecting the survival efficacy through estimated average hazard ratios and the Schoenfeld formula.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the study of cancer across research labs around the globe; however, genomic testing in clinical settings remains limited. Advances in sequencing reliability, pipeline analysis, accumulation of relevant data, and the reduction of costs are rapidly increasing the feasibility of NGS-based clinical decision making. Methods: We report the development of MammaSeq, a breast cancer-specific NGS panel, targeting 79 genes and 1369 mutations, optimized for use in primary and metastatic breast cancer. To validate the panel, 46 solid tumors and 14 plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 2311× and 1820×, respectively. Variants were called using Ion Torrent Suite 4.0 and annotated with cravat CHASM. CNVKit was used to call copy number variants in the solid tumor cohort. The oncoKB Precision Oncology Database was used to identify clinically actionable variants. Droplet digital PCR was used to validate select ctDNA mutations. Results: In cohorts of 46 solid tumors and 14 ctDNA samples from patients with advanced breast cancer, we identified 592 and 43 protein-coding mutations. Mutations per sample in the solid tumor cohort ranged from 1 to 128 (median 3), and the ctDNA cohort ranged from 0 to 26 (median 2.5). Copy number analysis in the solid tumor cohort identified 46 amplifications and 35 deletions. We identified 26 clinically actionable variants (levels 1-3) annotated by OncoKB, distributed across 20 out of 46 cases (40%), in the solid tumor cohort. Allele frequencies of ESR1 and FOXA1 mutations correlated with CA.27.29 levels in patient-matched blood draws. Conclusions: In solid tumor biopsies and ctDNA, MammaSeq detects clinically actionable mutations (OncoKB levels 1-3) in 22/46 (48%) solid tumors and in 4/14 (29%) of ctDNA samples.

Following ligand binding, EGFR heterodimerizes with other HER family members, such as HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2). Previously, we showed that the EGFR is upregulated in trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer cells. This study is aimed to determine the downstream effects on transcription following EGFR upregulation in HER2+ breast cancer cells. Methods: RNA-sequence and ChIP-sequence for H3K18ac and H3K27ac (Histone H3 lysine K18 and K27 acetylation) were conducted following an Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) treatment time course in HER2+ breast cancer cells, SKBR3. The levels of several proteins of interest were confirmed by western blot analysis. The cellular localization of proteins of interest was examined using biochemically fractionated lysates followed by western blot analysis. Results: Over the course of 24 h, EGFR stimulation resulted in the modulation of over 4000 transcripts. Moreover, our data demonstrates that EGFR/HER2 signaling regulates the epigenome, with global H3K18ac and H3K27ac oscillating as a function of time following EGF treatment. RNA-sequence data demonstrates the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs) and delayed early genes (DEGs) within 1 h of EGF treatment. More importantly, we have identified members of the S100 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein) gene family as likely direct targets of EGFR signaling as H3K18ac, H3K27ac and pol2 (RNA polymerase II) increase near the transcription start sites of some of these genes. Conclusions: Our data suggests that S100 proteins, which act as Ca2+ sensors, could play a role in EGF induced tumor cell growth and metastasis, contribute to trastuzumab resistance and cell migration and that they are likely drug targets in HER2+ breast cancer. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061292078

However, since only a minority of patients respond to single-agent therapies, methods to test the potential anti-tumor activity of rational combination therapies are still needed. Conventional murine xenograft models have been hampered by their immune-compromised status; thus, we developed a hematopoietic humanized mouse model, hu-CB-BRGS, and used it to study anti-tumor human immune responses to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line and patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) xenografts (PDX). Methods: BALB/c-Rag2 null Il2rγ null SIRPα NOD (BRGS) pups were humanized through transplantation of cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ cells. Mice were evaluated for human chimerism in the blood and assigned into experimental untreated or nivolumab groups based on chimerism. TNBC cell lines or tumor tissue from established CRC PDX models were implanted into both flanks of humanized mice and treatments ensued once tumors reached a volume of ~150mm 3 . Tumors were measured twice weekly. At end of study, immune organs and tumors were collected for immunological assessment. Results: Humanized PDX models were successfully established with a high frequency of tumor engraftment. Humanized mice treated with anti-PD-1 exhibited increased anti-tumor human T-cell responses coupled with decreased Treg and myeloid populations that correlated with tumor growth inhibition. Combination therapies with anti-PD-1 treatment in TNBC-bearing mice reduced tumor growth in multi-drug cohorts. Finally, as observed in human colorectal patients, anti-PD-1 therapy had a strong response to a microsatellite-high CRC PDX that correlated with a higher number of human CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells in the tumor. Conclusion: Hu-CB-BRGS mice represent an in vivo model to study immune checkpoint blockade to human tumors. The human immune system in the mice is inherently suppressed, similar to a tumor microenvironment, and thus allows growth of human tumors. However, the suppression can be released by anti-PD-1 therapies and inhibit tumor growth of some tumors. The model offers ample access to lymph and tumor cells for in-depth immunological analysis. The tumor growth inhibition correlates with increased CD8 IFNγ+ tumor infiltrating T cells. These hu-CB-BRGS mice provide a relevant preclinical animal model to facilitate prioritization of hypothesis-driven combination immunotherapies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061278561

We propose the use of exosomal miRNAs and circulating tumor cells as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in these patients. Methods: Fifty-three breast cancer women initially diagnosed with localized breast cancer under neoadjuvant chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled in this study. However, six of them were later re-evaluated and diagnosed as metastatic breast cancer patients by PET-CT scan. Additionally, eight healthy donors were included. Circulating tumor cells and serum exosomal miRNAs were isolated from blood samples before and at the middle of neoadjuvant therapy and exosomal miRNA levels analyzed by qPCR. Results: Before neoadjuvant therapy, exosomal miRNA-21 and 105 expression levels were higher in metastatic versus non-metastatic patients and healthy donors. Likewise, higher levels of miRNA-222 were observed in basal-like (p = 0.037) and in luminal B versus luminal A (p = 0.0145) tumor subtypes. Exosomal miRNA-222 levels correlated with clinical and pathological variables such as progesterone receptor status (p = 0.017) and Ki67 (p = 0.05). During neoadjuvant treatment, exosomal miRNA-21 expression levels directly correlated with tumor size (p = 0.039) and inversely with Ki67 expression (p = 0.031). Finally, higher levels of exosomal miRNA-21, miRNA-222, and miRNA-155 were significantly associated with the presence of circulating tumor cells. Conclusion: Liquid biopsies based on exosomal miRNAs and circulating tumor cells can be a complementary clinical tool for improving breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061121429

D-Asp and D-Ser, which are co-agonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, showed significantly elevated levels in MCF-7 cancer cells compared to MCF-10A cells. This may result from upregulated enzymatic racemases. Possible roles of these D-amino acids in promoting breast cancer proliferation by regulating NMDA receptors were indicated. D-Asn may also be able to serve as exchange currency, like specific L-amino acids, for the required uptake of essential amino acids and other low abundance nonessential amino acids which were elevated nearly 60 fold in cancer cells. The relative levels of specific L- and D-amino acids can be used as malignancy indicators (MIs) for the breast cancer cell line in this study. High MIs (>50) result from the increased demands of specific essential amino acids. Very low MIs (<1) result from the increased demands of specific D-amino acids (i.e., D-Ser, D-Asp) or the cellular release of amino acid exchange currency (i.e., L- and D-Asn) used in the upregulated amino acid antiporters to promote cancer cell proliferation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056479012

The selective ER degrader (SERD), fulvestrant, is effective in patients with metastatic breast cancer, but its intramuscular route of administration and low bioavailability are major clinical limitations. Methods: Here, we studied the pharmacology of a new oral SERD, AZD9496, in a panel of in vitro and in vivo endocrine-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer models. Results: In endocrine-sensitive models, AZD9496 inhibited cell growth and blocked ER activity in the presence or absence of oestrogen. In vivo, in the presence of oestrogen, short-term AZD9496 treatment, like fulvestrant, resulted in tumour growth inhibition and reduced expression of ER-dependent genes. AZD9496 inhibited cell growth in oestrogen deprivation-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines and xenograft models that retain ER expression. AZD9496 effectively reduced ER levels and ER-induced transcription. Expression analysis of short-term treated tumours showed that AZD9496 potently inhibited classic oestrogen-induced gene transcription, while simultaneously increasing expression of genes negatively regulated by ER, including genes potentially involved in escape pathways of endocrine resistance. Conclusions: These data suggest that AZD9496 is a potent anti-oestrogen that antagonises and degrades ER with anti-tumour activity in both endocrine-sensitive and endocrine-resistant models. © 2018, Cancer Research UK.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058659434

Methods: Serum trastuzumab concentrations were obtained from 1582 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), early breast cancer (EBC), advanced gastric cancer (AGC), or other tumor types/healthy volunteers in 18 phase I, II, and III trials and analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Results: A two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination best described the data. During treatment, linear clearance (CL) dominated, resulting in a total CL of 0.173–0.337 L/day, which is similar to other IgG1 monoclonal antibodies. Covariates influencing CL were baseline body weight, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, gastric cancer, and the presence of liver metastases. MBC and EBC had similar PK parameters, while CL was higher in AGC. Simulations indicated that at least 95% of patients with BC reach concentrations < 1 µg/mL (~ 97% washout) by 7 months. A dose delay in BC or AGC patients of > 1 week would take approximately 6 weeks to get back within steady-state exposure range. Conclusions: Trastuzumab PK for the intravenous formulation was well-described across cancer types, disease status, and regimens. No dose adjustment is required for any of the identified patient covariates. A 7-month serum washout period for trastuzumab is recommended. A reloading dose is required if a maintenance dose is missed by > 1 week. © 2018, The Author(s).","Final",,2-s2.0-85057097917

Each of these options lead to a similar long-term survival rate, but result in significant differences in appearance, function, cost, recurrence rate, and various other relevant considerations. However, the time available for detailed communication with each patient is often limited in clinics, which puts these women under great psychological stress and can hinder their surgery-related decision making. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a multipurpose surgery decision-making website providing medical information, psychological support, and decision-related simulation for women during breast cancer surgery-related decision making. METHODS: Using the 4 steps of action research, which involve multigroup teamwork via regular team meetings, the following were performed: (1) Planning: searching, analyzing, and evaluating health websites to consensually decide the major infrastructure; (2) Action: work was performed simultaneously in 4 groups, which consisted of medical information collection and editing, patient interviews and data extraction, webpage content design, and programming to create or host the website; (3) Evaluation: the website was tested by clinical experts and focus groups of former breast cancer patients to assess its effectiveness and pinpoint appropriate improvements; and (4) Reflection: constant dialogue was conducted between the various participants at each step, which was used as the foundation and motivation of next plan-action-evaluation-reflection circle. RESULTS: Using the action research approach, we completed the development of our website, which includes the following: (1) ""Woman's Voice""-an animated comic depicting the story of a female breast cancer patient with interspersed questions for the users that will help them better empathize with the experience; (2) ""Cancer Information Treasure House""-providing breast cancer surgery-related information through text, tables, pictures and a presentation video; (3) ""Decision-making Simulator""-helping patients think through and check the pros and cons of the different surgical options via visual-based interactions including ""Stairs Climbing"" and ""Fruit of Hope""; and (4) ""Recommended Links""-providing reliable websites for further reference. Additionally, we have further improved the website based on the feedback received from postsurgery breast cancer patients and clinicians. We hope to continue improving to better meet both the patients' and health providers' needs and become a practical decision-making aid for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We have created the first breast cancer surgery decision-making assistance tool in Taiwan using a ""Web-based"" and multifunctional website design. This site aims to provide health care knowledge, psychological healing, and emotional support functions, as well as decision-making capability enhancement simulations. We look forward to assisting breast cancer patients in their decision-making process and expect our website to increase patient's autonomy and improve their communication with clinicians. ©Yu-Ting Hung, Ching-Fang Wu, Te-Hsin Liang, Shin-Shang Chou, Guan-Liang Chen, Pei-Ni Wu, Guan-Rong Su, Tsuey-Huah Jang, Chang-Yi Liu, Ching-Yen Wang, Ling-Ming Tseng, Shuh-Jen Sheu.

We previously found that depleting calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) induces cell death selectively in TNBC cells, while sparing normal cells. Therefore, we asked whether CIB1 depletion further enhances tumor-specific killing when combined with either the commonly used chemotherapeutic, docetaxel, or the cell death-inducing ligand, TRAIL. Methods: We targeted CIB1 by RNA interference in MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, docetaxel-resistant MDA-MB-436 TNBC cells and ME16C normal breast epithelial cells alone or combination with docetaxel or TRAIL. Cell death was quantified via trypan blue exclusion using flow cytometry and cell death mechanisms were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell surface levels of TRAIL receptors were measured by flow cytometry analysis. Results: CIB1 depletion combined with docetaxel significantly enhanced tumor-specific cell death relative to each treatment alone. The enhanced cell death strongly correlated with caspase-8 activation, a hallmark of death receptor-mediated apoptosis. The death receptor TRAIL-R2 was upregulated in response to CIB1 depletion, which sensitized TNBC cells to the ligand TRAIL, resulting in a synergistic increase in cell death. In addition to death receptor-mediated apoptosis, both combination treatments activated a non-apoptotic mechanism, called paraptosis. Interestingly, these combination treatments also induced nearly complete death of docetaxel-resistant MDA-MB-436 cells, again via apoptosis and paraptosis. In contrast, neither combination treatment induced cell death in normal ME16C cells. Conclusion: Novel combinations of CIB1 depletion with docetaxel or TRAIL selectively enhance naive and docetaxel-resistant TNBC cell death while sparing normal cell. Therefore, combination therapies that target CIB1 could prove to be a safe and durable strategy for treatment of TNBC and potentially other cancers. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061121069

We aimed to determine the effects of moderate (MCT)- versus high-intensity interval training (HIT) on vascular function parameters in physically inactive adults. We hypothesized that individualized HIT prescription would improve the vascular function parameters more than the MCT in a greater proportion of individuals. Methods: Twenty-one inactive adults were randomly allocated to receive either MCT group (60-75% of their heart rate reserve, [HRR] or HIT group (4 min at 85-95% of peak HRR), 3 days a week for 12 weeks. Vascular function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, FMD [%], normalized brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, FMDn [%], aortic pulse wave velocity, PWV [m·s - 1 ], AIx, augmentation index: aortic and brachial [%]), were measured at baseline and over 12 weeks of training.

Results: FMD changed by - 1.0% (SE 2.1, d = 0.388) in the MCT group, and + 1.8% (SE 1.8, d = 0.699) in the HIT group (no significant difference between groups: 2.9% [95% CI, - 3.0 to 8.8]. PWV changed by + 0.1 m·s - 1 (SE 0.2, d = 0.087) in the MCT group but decreased by - 0.4 m·s - 1 in the HIT group (SE 0.2, d = 0.497), with significant difference between groups: - 0.4 [95% CI, - 0.2 to - 0.7]. There was not a significant difference in the prevalence of no-responder for FMD (%) between the MCT and HIT groups (66% versus 36%, P = 0.157). Regarding PWV (m·s - 1 ), an analysis showed that the prevalence of no-responder was 77% (7 cases) in the MCT group and 45% (5 cases) in the HIT group (P = 0.114). Conclusions: Under the conditions of the present study, both groups experienced changed in vascular function parameters.

Hawaii is one of the most racially/ethnically diverse states in the U.S. Overall, Hawaii ranks 5 th highest for breast cancer incidence in the nation (2010–2014) and rates have increased in recent years despite a stable national trend. In contrast, for breast cancer mortality, Hawaii has the 3 rd lowest rate in the nation, with rates demonstrating a steady decline for nearly 3 decades. Methods: We examined incidence and mortality trends from 1984–2013 across the five major racial/ethnic populations of Hawaii (Native Hawaiian, White, Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino) using Hawaii's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data. Results: With the exception of Chinese, all groups experienced increasing incidence over the thirty year period. While Japanese experienced the most pronounced recent increase, with incidence now exceeding that of Whites, their mortality rates have remained low for decades. Native Hawaiians have consistently had the highest incidence and mortality rates in the state. The incidence rates of hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer were higher among Japanese and Native Hawaiians as compared to Whites. Relative to Whites, Native Hawaiians also had a higher incidence rate of the HER2-positive subtype and, Japanese, of the triple-negative (HR-/HER2-) subtype of breast cancer.

Little is known about the prognostic value of PR by tumor grade. We assessed this in two independent datasets. Patients and Methods: Women with primary operable, invasive ER+ HER-2 negative breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2012, treated at University Hospitals Leuven, were included. We assessed the association of PR status and subtype (grade 1–2 vs. grade 3) with distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) and breast cancer-specific survival. The interaction between PR status and subtype was investigated, and associations of PR status by subtype were calculated. The BIG 1-98 data set was used for validation. Results: In total, 4,228 patients from Leuven and 5,419 from BIG 1-98 were analyzed. In the Leuven cohort, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of PR-positive versus PR-negative tumors for DRFI was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50–0.89). For the interaction with subtype (p =.34), the HR of PR status was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61–1.01) in luminal A-like and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.46–0.76) in luminal B-like tumors. In luminal A-like tumors, observed 5-year cumulative incidences of distant recurrence were 4.1% for PR-negative and 2.8% for PR-positive tumors, and in luminal B-like 18.7% and 9.2%, respectively. In the BIG 1-98 cohort, similar results were observed; for the interaction with subtype (p =.12), the adjusted HR of PR status for DRFI was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.57–1.35) in luminal A-like and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.43–0.77) in luminal B-like tumors. Observed 5-year cumulative incidences were similar. Conclusion: PR positivity may be more protective against metastatic relapse in luminal B-like versus luminal A-like breast cancer, but no strong conclusions can be made. In absolute risk, results suggest an absent PR is clinically more important in high compared with low proliferative ER+ HER-2 negative tumors. Implications for Practice: An absent progesterone receptor (PR) predicts a worse outcome in women treated for an estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. As low proliferative tumors lacking PR are now also classified high risk, the prognostic value of PR across risk groups was studied. Despite a negative test for interaction of the prognostic value of PR by tumor grade, the magnitude of an absent PR on breast cancer relapse is much larger in high than in low proliferative breast cancers. © AlphaMed Press 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85053262507

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal cell type in the breast tumour microenvironment, may contribute to cancer progression through interaction with tumour cells. Nonetheless, little is known about the details of the underlying mechanism. Here we found that interaction of interleukin 32 (IL32) with integrin β3 (encoded by ITGB3; a member of the integrin family) mediating the cross-talk between CAFs and breast cancer cells plays a crucial role in CAF-induced breast tumour invasiveness. IL32, an ‘RGD’ motif–containing cytokine, was found to be abundantly expressed in CAFs. Integrin β3 turned out to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAF-derived IL32 specifically bound to integrin β3 through the RGD motif, thus activating intracellular downstream p38 MAPK signalling in breast cancer cells. This signalling increased the expression of EMT markers (fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and promoted tumour cell invasion. Counteracting IL32 activity, a knockdown of IL32 or integrin β3 led to specific inactivation of p38 MAPK signalling in tumour cells. Blockage of the p38 MAPK pathway also diminished IL32-induced expression of EMT markers and breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, our data indicate that CAF-secreted IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin β3–p38 MAPK signalling. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85056785644

This study sought to examine how information is exchanged between patients and clinicians during chemotherapy treatment regarding pain, depression, fatigue, and nausea experienced among the most prevalent non-English-speaking group in the USA, Hispanic breast cancer survivors. Methods: Hispanic breast cancer patients and clinicians participated in focus groups to examine Hispanic breast cancer survivors’ experience and patient-physician communication of symptoms during chemotherapy. Three separate focus groups (English language with patients, Spanish language with patients, and English language with clinicians) were conducted. All participants completed a demographic questionnaire. Results: Six breast cancer survivors participated in the English-language focus group, ten breast cancer survivors participated in the Spanish-language focus group, and five clinicians participated. Presence and communication of depressive symptoms between the English- and Spanish-language groups differed, with the majority of the English-language group sharing their experiences of depressive symptoms while those in the Spanish-language group did not report depressive symptoms. Results also indicated that most patients were unhappy with the response of clinicians regarding their reported symptoms. Several barriers to effective patient-clinician communication, including limited physician time, lack of patient knowledge, timidity, and language, were identified.

Patients and Methods: A set of 2138 examinations (1978 women) given a BI-RADS 4 with matching pathology results were analyzed. Predictors such as patient demographics, clinical risk factors, and imaging-derived features such as BI-RADS assessment and qualitative breast density were considered. Independent predictors of breast cancer were determined by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results: In univariate analysis, age, race, body mass index, age at first live birth, BI-RADS assessment, qualitative breast density, and risk triggers were found to be independent predictors. In multivariate analysis, age, BI-RADS score, breast density, race, presence of a lump, and number of risk triggers were the most predictive. An integrative logistic regression model achieved a performance of 0.84 cross-validated area under the curve. No variable was a constant independent predictor when stratifying the population on the basis of the BI-RADS score. Conclusion: While BI-RADS assessment remains the strongest predictor of breast cancer, the inclusion of clinical risk factors such as age, breast density, presence of a lump, and number of risk triggers derived from guidelines improves the specificity of identifying individuals with imaging descriptors associated with BI-RADS 4A and 4B that are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Overdiagnosis of breast cancer is an ongoing concern, particularly in women who receive a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 assessment.

Materials and Methods: In this institutional review board–approved retrospective study, we collected 331 Chinese women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015. This cohort included 29 triple-negative, 45 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, 36 luminal A, and 221 luminal B lesions. A set of 39 quantitative radiomic features, including morphologic, grayscale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmented lesion area. Three binary classifications of the subtypes were performed: triple-negative vs non–triple-negative, HER2-enriched vs non–HER2-enriched, and luminal (A + B) vs nonluminal. The Naive Bayes machine learning scheme was employed for the classification, and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator method was used to select the most predictive features for the classifiers. Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy. Results: The model that used the combination of both the craniocaudal and the mediolateral oblique view images achieved the overall best performance than using either of the two views alone, yielding an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (or accuracy) of 0.865 (0.796) for triple-negative vs non–triple-negative, 0.784 (0.748) for HER2-enriched vs non–HER2-enriched, and 0.752 (0.788) for luminal vs nonluminal subtypes. Twelve most predictive features were selected by the least absolute shrink age and selection operator method and four of them (ie, roundness, concavity, gray mean, and correlation) showed a statistical significance (P <.05) in the subtype classification. Conclusions: Our study showed that quantitative radiomic imaging features of breast tumor extracted from digital mammograms are associated with breast cancer subtypes.

Screening rates differ greatly between US counties, providing a natural opportunity to investigate effects of screening. We compared mammography screening rates with the types and outcomes of breast cancers diagnosed in US counties. The county screening rate was defined as the proportion of women age ≥40 with ≥1 mammogram in the past 2 years (range, 34–91%). Two periods were analyzed: 1975–2009 (612,941 breast cancer cases, 195 counties) and 1996–2009 (645,057 cases, 211–547 counties). Multiple signs of overdiagnosis were observed: First, breast cancer incidence increased as screening became common. Second, incidence stopped increasing once screening rates stabilized. Third, the increases in incidence were limited to age groups receiving screening. Fourth, the increases were larger in counties where screening became more common. Fifth, the increases were limited to small and early-stage breast cancers (which are consistent with overdiagnosis). Sixth, compensatory reductions in large and advanced-stage breast cancers were much smaller than the increases. Difference-in-differences regression analysis suggested 31% (95% CI: 28–34%) of breast cancers diagnosed in 1996–2009 were overdiagnosed. Screening rates correlated with increased incidence for all hormone receptor statuses, HER2 statuses, and grades. Reductions in breast cancer mortality during 1975–2009 were similar in screened and unscreened age groups. Overall, we found repeated signs that breast cancer overdiagnosis is widespread in the US, but the biological nature of overdiagnosed tumors remains unclear. Mortality benefits of screening, though they may be present and substantial, could not be detected at the population level. © 2018 UICC","Final",,2-s2.0-85056177265

The objective of this study is to compare acute coronary events (ACE) among the general population and women with breast cancer after adjuvant RT. Secondary analysis evaluated whether a healthy lifestyle could protect against RT-related cardiac toxicity. Methods: The National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (2002–2013) was used to compare ACE risks among 1015 women with breast cancer and among 8120 women without cancer who were matched according to age, comorbidities, and smoking history. The risk of developing ACE over time while accounting for competing risks from other causes of death was analyzed. Results: During 6.1 ± 3.0 years of follow-up, the 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of ACE were 5.5% and 11.3%, respectively. The breast cancer survivors who underwent breast radiotherapy and population-based matched sample had similar risks of ACE (hazard ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.69–1.28). However, in the sensitivity analysis, breast cancer survivors had increased risks of ACE if they did not exercise (hazard ratio 2.74, confidence interval: 1.27–5.91) or had a disability (hazard ratio 21.9, confidence interval: 2.50–191.6). Conclusions: In this matched cohort study, the cardiac risk after adjuvant RT increased with decreasing physical activity. The long-term effect of physical activity on ACE is uncertain, but these results can increase physicians' awareness of the approaches to increase exercise participation level among women undergoing RT for breast cancer.

Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) secretion induced by IL-6 and OSM may also be subtype-dependent. Utilizing datasets from Oncomine, we show that poor survival of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) breast cancer patients is correlated with both high VEGF expression and high cytokine or cytokine receptor expression in tumors. Importantly, epidermal growth factor receptor-negative (HER2-), but not HER2-positive (HER2+), patient survival is significantly lower with high tumor co-expression of VEGF and OSM, OSMRβ IL-6, or IL-6Rα compared to low co-expression. Furthermore, assessment of HER2- breast cancer cells in vitro identified unique signaling differences regulating cytokine-induced VEGF secretion. The levels of VEGF secretion were analyzed by ELISA with siRNAs for hypoxia inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Specifically, we found that estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) MDA-MB-231 cells respond only to OSM through STAT3 signaling, while ER+ T47D cells respond to both OSM and IL-6, though to IL-6 to a lesser extent. Additionally, in the ER+ T47D cells, OSM signals through both STAT3 and HIF1α. These results highlight that the survival of breast cancer patients with high co-expression of VEGF and IL-6 family cytokines is dependent on breast cancer subtype. Thus, the heterogeneity of human breast cancer in relation to IL-6 family cytokines and VEGF may have important implications in clinical treatment options, disease progression, and ultimately patient prognosis. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85056248862

Using latent profile analysis, women who reported a low need for preventive therapy and strong medication concerns were less likely to initiate tamoxifen treatment. Medication beliefs are targets for supporting informed decision-making. © 2018 The AuthorsIntroduction: Uptake of preventive therapies for breast cancer is low. We examined whether women at increased risk of breast cancer can be categorized into groups with similar medication beliefs, and whether belief group membership was prospectively associated with uptake of preventive therapy. Patients and Methods: Women (n = 732) attending an appointment to discuss breast cancer risk were approached; 408 (55.7%) completed the Beliefs About Medicines and the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines questionnaires. Uptake of tamoxifen at 3 months was reported in 258 (63.2%). The optimal number of belief groups were identified using latent profile analysis. Results: Uptake of tamoxifen was 14.7% (38/258). One in 5 women (19.4%; 78/402) reported a strong need for tamoxifen. The model fit statistics supported a 2-group model. Both groups held weak beliefs about their need for tamoxifen for current and future health. Group 2 (38%; 154/406 of the sample) reported stronger concerns about tamoxifen and medicines in general, and stronger perceived sensitivity to the negative effects of medicines compared with group 1 (62%; 252/406). Women with low necessity and lower concerns (group 1) were more likely to initiate tamoxifen (18.3%; 33/180) than those with low necessity and higher concerns (group 2) (6.4%; 5/78). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, the odds ratio was 3.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-10.51; P =.036). Conclusion: Uptake of breast cancer preventive therapy was low. A subgroup of women reported low need for preventive therapy and strong medication concerns. These women were less likely to initiate tamoxifen.

We aimed to develop predictive models to identify estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor negative (HER2−) early breast cancer (ESBC) and advanced stage breast cancer (ASBC) in a claims database. Methods: Female breast cancer cases in Anthem's Cancer Care Quality Program served as the gold standard validation sample. Predictive models were developed from clinical knowledge and empirically from claims data using logistic and lasso regression. Model performance was assessed by classification rates and c-statistics. Models were applied to the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (claims) to identify cohorts of women with ER+/HER2− ESBC and ASBC. Results: The validation sample included 3184 women with ER+/HER2− ESBC and 1436 with ER+/HER2− ASBC. Predictive models for ER+/HER2− ESBC and ASBC included 25 and 20 factors, respectively. Models had robust discrimination in identifying cases (c-stat = 0.92 for ESBC and 0.95 for ASBC). Compared with a traditional a priori algorithm developed with clinical insight alone, the ER+/HER2− ASBC-predictive model had better positive predictive value (PPV) (0.91, 95% CI, 0.90-0.93, vs 0.69, 95% CI, 0.66-0.73) and sensitivity (0.54 vs 0.35).

Anoikis is defined as cell-death that occurs due to loss of cell adhesion. During the course of cancer progression, tumor cells acquire resistance to anoikis. However, mechanisms of anoikis resistance are not clear. Human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing breast tumors are known to be highly aggressive and metastatic. The mechanisms correlating HER2 with metastasis are poorly understood. We observed increased anoikis resistance in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. In addition, we identified that HER2 overexpression was also associated with increased sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling especially GLI2, and that inhibition of SHH pathway suppressed anoikis resistance. GSK3β is known to facilitate proteasome-mediated degradation of GLI2. Moreover, we observed that silencing of GLI2 resulted in reduced migration and invasion of HER2 overexpressing cells. Anoikis resistant HER2 overexpressing cells also showed increased rate and extent of metastasis in vivo, as compared to wild type anoikis resistant cells. Taken together, this study indicates a novel role of HER2/GSK3β/GLI2 axis in anoikis resistance and metastasis, and that GLI2 could be a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056187192

Systemic treatment options for metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents with low response rates. This encouraged the clinical development of sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, a potential target in epithelial cancer such as TNBC. Areas covered: We summarize the key features, pharmacokinetics, and the safety and efficacy data of sacituzumab govitecan. We also discuss the future directions of this novel therapeutic agent for mTNBC. Expert opinion: Based on the efficacy and tolerability observed in the phase 1/2 clinical trial, sacituzumab govitecan was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the Food and Drug Administration as ≥3 rd line therapy for mTNBC. Novel treatment modalities for the management of mTNBC are necessary to improve the care of this aggressive disease. Sacituzumab govitecan represents an important advance in the treatment of mTNBC because of its efficacy and tolerability. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058695280

The serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 and its functional polymorphism 5-HTTLPR have been extensively studied as factors in the development of depression. Many research studies have demonstrated conflicting results, and the contribution of 5-HTTLPR to depression is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the relationship between depressive symptoms and serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms between women with early-stage breast cancer 1 year following initial diagnosis and surgery and matched controls. Methods: Participants (N = 125), included postmenopausal women following breast cancer surgery (n = 80) and age-and education-matched healthy controls (n = 45). The genetic elements of interest were the long (LA) and short (S) alleles of 5-HTTLPR, as well as the single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531 A > G within the L-allele (LG). DNA was extracted from either blood or saliva and analyzed for the SLC6A4 polymorphisms. The outcome measures for this longitudinal study included Beck Depression Inventory scores and physical function domain scores from the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36. Results: Women with breast cancer demonstrated greater depressive symptomatology and decreased physical function compared to healthy controls. The LA/LA genotype was associated with increased depressive symptomatology in the overall sample and within the controls. The LA/LA genotype appeared with greater frequency in the experimental group, but the relationship with increased depressive symptoms was not observed. Physical function was a significant (p < 0.00) predictor of depressive symptoms in both groups at 12 months. Conclusion: The relationship between 5-HTTLPR and depressive symptomatology in breast cancer patients remains unclear. A potential clinical application includes monitoring physical function and addressing increased depressive symptoms as physical function declines. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85049581328

Methods: Data on female non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), and Hispanic stage I-III breast cancer patients diagnosed in 2011 were obtained from a project to enhance population-based National Program of Cancer Registry data for Comparative Effectiveness Research. Hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were used to classify subtypes: HR+/HER2-; HR+/HER2+; HR-/HER2-; and HR-/HER2 +. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the association of race/ethnicity with three outcomes: chemotherapy (yes, no), neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no), and delayed chemotherapy (yes, no). Covariates included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, other cancer treatment, and participating states/areas. Results: The study included 25,535 patients (72.1% NHW, 13.7% NHB, and 14.2% Hispanics). NHB with HR+/HER2- (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.04–1.42) and Hispanics with HR-/HER2- (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15–2.28) were more likely to receive chemotherapy than their NHW counterparts. Both NHB and Hispanics were more likely to receive delayed chemotherapy than NHW, and the pattern was consistent across each subtype. No racial/ethnic differences were found in the receipt of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Compared to NHW with the same subtype, NHB with HR+/HER2- and Hispanics with HR-/HER2- have higher odds of using chemotherapy; however, they are more likely to receive delayed chemotherapy, regardless of subtype. Whether the increased chemotherapy use among NHB with HR+/HER2- indicates overtreatment needs further investigation.

Despite the availability of breast cancer screening programs in Brazil through the public health system, some women do not participate in these programs due to structural and/or inter/intrapersonal barriers. The Community Health Worker (CHW) model is a promising approach to reach these women who have not been reached through other efforts. This paper describes a participatory approach for capacity building of CHWs to promote breast cancer screening among low-income women 50 years of age and older in a southern city in Brazil as a combined effort between two academic institutions, the municipal health care system, and a local non-profit organization. The capacity building program consisted of an 8-hour training focusing on knowledge (e.g., breast cancer and screening) and skills (e.g., communication skills, basic principles of behavior change) to promote breast cancer screening among community members. Pre- and post-test questionnaires assessed changes in breast cancer knowledge and self-perceived knowledge and confidence (N=44). There was a significant increase in objective knowledge regarding breast cancer overall, risk factors, and behavior change strategies between pre- and post-test. There was also a significant increase in self-perceived knowledge and confidence, items related to knowledge about breast cancer, breast cancer early detection methods, and the ability to solve problems between pre- and post-test as well as a significant increase in their confidence to motivate women to get a mammogram. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of welldeveloped capacity building programs to promote breast cancer screening among health care professionals, especially those with limited educational attainment, such as CHWs. © The Author 2017.

Methods: This report describes vitamin D supplement use by 553 breast cancer patient/survivors (193 who used a naturopathic oncology [NO] provider and 360 who did not) participating in a matched cohort study of breast cancer outcomes. Results: We found that more than half of breast cancer patients reported using vitamin D supplements. Women who received care from NO providers in early survivorship may be more likely to use vitamin D supplements (P <.05). Approximately 30% of breast cancer patients with blood levels recorded in their medical chart were potentially vitamin D deficient (<30 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplement use at study enrollment was associated with higher levels of self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at enrollment (P <.05) and predicted better HRQOL at 6-month follow-up (P <.05). Sufficient blood levels of vitamin D recorded between enrollment and follow-up were also associated with better HRQOL at follow-up (P <.05). Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation by breast cancer patients is common both during and after treatment for breast cancer, but deficiency may also be common. NO and conventional providers may be able to promote vitamin D sufficiency through vitamin D supplementation and by encouraging healthy solar exposure. Further studies should be undertaken examining whether vitamin D supplementation and higher blood levels might improve HRQOL among women with breast cancer in early survivorship. © The Author(s) 2019.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062168776

Influence of ODXRS on staging is limited to T2N0 tumors that are either GR 3 and strongly ER + and PR + or GR 1-2 and ER + /PR−. Sixty-one percent of cases of recurrence (11/18) were downstaged using the new staging system. Conclusion: ODXRS has little influence on staging, thus supporting the view of the AJCC 8th edition expert panel that ODX is not required for staging. Downstaging of more than half of cases of recurrence suggests that continued refinement of the staging system, as proposed by the expert panel, could be beneficial in this subgroup of patients. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057427796

Study design: A decision-analytic model was designed comparing eight different strategies for scheduled delivery at 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37 weeks gestation. Optimal breast cancer treatment was assumed to be delayed until after delivery. Baseline estimates of the stage- and subtype-specific mortality and the impact of delayed cancer treatment on 5-year survival rates were obtained from the literature. Outcomes factored into the model included the risk of intrauterine fetal demise, spontaneous delivery, respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral palsy, and neonatal demise at each gestational age. Univariate sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the robustness of our model. Results: For women with stage I–II breast cancer, delivery at 36 weeks yielded the highest number of overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), while maternal QALYs were maximized with delivery at 34 weeks. For stage III and IV disease, maternal QALYs were maximized at 31 and 30 weeks, respectively. For women with estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal receptor-2 negative breast cancer, both maternal QALYs and overall QALYs were maximized with delivery at 36 weeks. More aggressive biological phenotypes were similarly associated with optimal delivery at decreasing gestational age. Our model was heavily driven by the baseline probability of maternal death within 5 years, in addition to the expected progression of disease and decreases in survival rates with each week of non-treatment, and remained robust across reasonable ranges for all variables of interest. Conclusions: For women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy, decisions regarding timing of delivery should take into consideration both cancer stage and hormone receptor subtype. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Final",,2-s2.0-85030182431

In this review, we address the technical requirements of PET/MRI including protocols and tracers, the potential of integrated localized breast PET/MRI exams, and possible applications of whole-body PET/MRI in breast cancer patients. Currently, PET/MRI can be performed on sequential and integrated PET/MRI scanners but, as not all practices can access these dedicated machines, several studies look at PET and MRI exams that are performed separately on separate scanners within a short time frame. This practice likely provides similar clinical data, although exact colocalization for iso-voxel analysis, currently performed only in research, is not possible. In PET/MRI, the MRI sequences are flexible and can be customized according to the aim of the exam. The most commonly used radiotracer is 18 F-FDG; however, tracers that image hypoxia and drug targets such as estrogen receptors and HER2 are in development and may increase the utility of PET/MRI. For dedicated breast PET/MRI, a potential advantage over standard breast MRI alone may be the complementary sensitivities of MRI for extent of disease within the breast and PET for axillary and internal mammary nodal metastases. Moreover, layers of multiparametric MRI and PET metrics derived from the index lesion are being investigated as predictors of response to neoadjuvant therapy. These data may eventually be able to be quantified and mined in a way that furthers radiomics and also precision medicine. Finally, in whole-body imaging of breast cancer patients, single-institution studies have found that PET/MRI detects more metastases than PET at about half the radiation dose, although a survival benefit has not been shown. For now, whole-body PET/MRI in breast cancer patients may be most relevant for young patients who may undergo serial surveillance exams. Level of Evidence: 3. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2. J. Magn.

We examined the joint effect of social support, social relationship strain, and rural-urban residence on stage at breast cancer diagnosis. Methods: Using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (n = 161,808), we describe the distribution of social, behavioral, and clinical factors by rural-urban residence among postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer (n = 7,120). We used rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes to categorize baseline residential addresses as urban, large rural city/town, or small rural town, and the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results staging system to categorize breast cancer stage at diagnosis (dichotomized as early or late). We then used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the relationship between rural-urban residence and stage at breast cancer diagnosis. We included separate interaction terms between rural-urban residence and social strain and social support to test for statistical interaction. Results: Of the social, behavioral, and clinical factors we examined, only younger age at WHI enrollment screening was significantly associated with late stage at breast cancer diagnosis (p = 0.003). Contrary to our hypothesis, rural-urban residence was not significantly associated with stage at breast cancer diagnosis among postmenopausal women ([adjusted OR, 95% CI] for urban compared with small town: 1.08 [0.76-1.53]; large town compared with small town: 1.16 [0.74-1.84]; and urban compared with large town: 0.93 [0.68-1.26]).The associations did not vary by social support or social strain (p for interaction between RUCA and social strain and social support, respectively: 0.99 and 0.17).

Women with breast cancer have specified the need for more information on nutrition and physical activity to deal with weight gain. The aims of this study were to assess the perceptions of Dutch HCPs on weight gain during chemotherapy and in addition evaluate whether and what kind of information on dietary intake and physical activity HCPs provide to prevent/treat weight gain during (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 34 HCPs involved in breast cancer care: general practitioners, oncologists, specialized nurses, and dieticians. Results: To date, little information about nutrition, physical activity, and weight gain is given during chemotherapy because it is not part of most HCPs’ training, it is not included in the guidelines and it is not the best time to bring up information in the opinion of HCPs. Weight gain was perceived as just a matter of a few kilos and not an important health issue during treatment. All HCPs felt it is better that women themselves addressed their weight gain after chemotherapy. Conclusion: More knowledge about health risks associated with chemotherapy-induced weight gain and how to combat these issues needs to be made readily available to the HCPs and should become part of their training. Existing patient guidelines should include information on how to prevent and/or reduce weight gain through self-management of nutrition intake and physical activity during and post chemotherapy. © 2018, The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85050213025

Patients and Methods: Decision trees were built through recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). The median follow-up for all 2161 patients was 114 months (9.5 years). Results: Local relapse in the treated breast was uncommon (actuarial rates after 5 and 10 years were 2.7% and 5.8%, respectively). In RPA, the first split was related to age (52 years), with younger patients having a significantly higher risk of local relapse. The younger patients were stratified further by lymph node ratio (LNR). In patients older than 52 years, lack of endocrine treatment was associated with significantly higher risk. DFS was 80.7% at 10 years. The first split was caused by LNR, and the group with unfavorable LNR (> 0.20) could not be stratified further. Ten-year DFS in this group was as low as 50.6%.

Methods: Forty BCS and 13 partners completed written reflections and participated in semi-structured interviews. Results: Analyses revealed five predominant sources of uncertainty for BCS and partners: perceptions of post-treatment body, worry about effects on relational partners, ethical concerns about dissatisfaction with sexual relationship (partners only), fears about future of the relationship, and apprehension about SH treatment futility. These concerns are linked to communication challenges for couples: supporting survivors’ body esteem, navigating potentially hurtful disclosures, responding to partners’ “obstructive behavior,” and believing communication is futile. Conclusions: Findings suggest women and partners find themselves caught in a destructive cycle that reinforces uncertainty and inadvertently perpetuates silence and relational distress. To disrupt the cycle of silence, BCS and partners need to know that their interpretation of the other person’s behaviors/needs is not always accurate. Strategies are required to help women and their partners express uncomfortable thoughts and feelings in safe and supportive environments.

Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of US-based mammography screening guidelines. Methods: We developed a microsimulation model to generate the natural history of invasive breast cancer and capture how screening and treatment modified the natural course of the disease. We used the model to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies, including annual screening starting at the age of 40 years, biennial screening starting at the age of 50 years, and a hybrid strategy that begins screening at the age of 45 years and transitions to biennial screening at the age of 55 years, combined with three cessation ages: 75 years, 80 years, and no upper age limit. Findings were summarized as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier. Results: The screening strategy that starts annual mammography at the age of 45 years and switches to biennial screening between the ages of 55 and 75 years was the most cost-effective, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,135/QALY. Probabilistic analysis showed that the hybrid strategy had the highest probability of being optimal when the societal willingness to pay was between $44,000/QALY and $103,500/QALY. Within the range of commonly accepted societal willingness to pay, no optimal strategy involved screening with a cessation age of 80 years or older. Conclusions: The screening strategy built on a hybrid design is the most cost-effective for average-risk women. By considering the balance between benefits and harms in forming its recommendations, this hybrid screening strategy has the potential to optimize the health care system's investment in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer. © 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research","Final",,2-s2.0-85052994666

The objective of our study was to compare the supplemental cancer yield and performance of breast MRI in women at higher-than-average risk for breast cancer after negative 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) or negative digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). MATERIALS AND METHODS. Retrospective review identified 4418 screening breast MRI examinations: 2291 were performed from January 2010 through January 2012 of patients with a negative FFDM examination in the 12 months before MRI (FFDM group), and 2127 were performed from January 2013 through January 2015 of patients with a negative DBT examination in the 12 months before MRI (DBT group). Screening indications included genetic predisposition, personal history of breast cancer or high-risk lesion, prior chest irradiation, family history, or other risk factors conferring a lifetime risk of greater than 20%. Supplemental cancer detection rate (CDR), abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), and positive predictive values (PPVs) were estimated with 95% exact CIs. Logistic regression analysis, adjusting for differences in patient demographics, was used to compare metrics. RESULTS. There was no significant difference in the CDR of MRI in the FFDM group versus the DBT group (11 vs 16 cancers per 1000 examinations, respectively; odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.4-1.2; p = 0.23). The AIR, PPV1, PPV2, and PPV3 were 7.4%, 15%, 23%, and 28% for the FFDM group and 7.3%, 22%, 33%, and 35% for the DBT group, with no statistical differences. Of the cancers detected in both groups, the majority were invasive, less than 1 cm, and node-negative. CONCLUSION. In women at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer screened with DBT, the supplemental CDR of MRI is similar to that of MRI after FFDM screening, with most cancers being invasive, subcentimeter, and node-negative. © 2019 American Roentgen Ray Society.

Analysis reveals how the surgeon addresses interactional challenges when providing this overview, including how to broach the rationale for administering chemotherapy, the possibility that cancer could spread to vital organs and prove fatal. To do this, the surgeon orients to the possibility that the patient has misconceptions about her risk of dying from breast cancer. She uses negatively-formulated assertions to invoke these possible misconceptions, making correction relevant and providing a point of entry into delicate interactional territory.

Breast cancer is a devastating disease, with different types of breast cancer recurring locally or distant as metastatic/advanced disease following initial treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the tumoricidal effect of a CD1d-binding glycolipid, called 7DW8-5, against a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line both in vitro and in vivo. Materials and Methods: Parental MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with human CD1d were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), followed by loading with glycolipids. After co-culturing with human iNKT cells, the cells were permeabilized and stained with Alexa Flour 647-conjugated antibody to active caspase-3, and analyzed using a BD LSR II. For the in vivo tumoricidal effect, MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with human CD1d and luciferase genes were injected into the mammary fat pad of female NOD/SCID/IL2rγnull (NSG) mice, followed by the injection of human iNKT cells with or without 7DW8-5, and the levels of luminescence were analyzed with whole-body imaging. Results: Human iNKT cells could kill CD1d-expressing human breast cancer cells in vitro in the presence of 7DW8-5, but not α-GalCer. As for in vivo, the adoptive transfer of human iNKT cells into tumor-challenged NSG mice significantly inhibited the growth of CD1d+ MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in the presence of 7DW8-5.

We sought to determine how often and in what manner preoperative breast MRI changed surgical management in an underserved patient population. Materials and methods: We examined the use of preoperative MRI at Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC), a public, tertiary hospital in lower Manhattan with a large underserved population. The BHC breast clinic database was used to identify patients who received preoperative MRI for breast cancer between January 2015 and December 2016. MRI was defined as changing surgical management in a positive manner if an MRI-detected abnormality had verification of malignancy in the final surgical specimen, confirming the MRI indication for wider excision or mastectomy, while MRI was defined to change surgical management in a negative manner if final pathology was discordant with MRI. Chi-square test was used to analyze characteristics of those who received MRI versus those who did not. Results: A total of 208 patients underwent breast surgery at BHC, and 62 patients underwent MRI for preoperative planning purposes. There were significant differences between the MRI and no MRI group in terms of ethnicity (P = 0.05), age (P < 0.01), and type of surgery (P = 0.03). 50% of the biopsies performed as a result of MRI were benign. MRI changed surgical management in 35 % of patients, most commonly by converting lumpectomy to mastectomy. Of cases in which MRI changed surgical management, most were positive changes. However, 4 patients underwent surgery and 11 patients underwent biopsy for benign pathology as a result of MRI findings.

This longitudinal substudy aimed to prospectively assess arm measurements and symptoms following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and axillary dissection in the ACOSOG/Alliance Z1071 trial to characterize the optimal approach to define lymphedema. Methods: Z1071 enrolled patients with cT0-4, N1-2, M0 disease treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients underwent axillary dissection. Bilateral limb volumes, circumferences, and related symptoms were assessed pre-surgery, 1–2 weeks post-surgery, and semiannually for 36 months. Lymphedema definitions included volume increase ≥ 10% or limb circumference increase ≥ 2 cm. Symptoms were assessed by the Lymphedema Breast Cancer Questionnaire. Results: In 488 evaluable patients, lymphedema incidence at 3 years by ≥ 10%-volume-increase was 60.3% (95% CI 55.0–66.2%) and by ≥ 2 cm-circumference increase was 75.4% (95% CI 70.8–80.2%). Symptoms of arm swelling and heaviness decreased from post-surgery for the first 18 months and then were relatively stable. The 3-year cumulative incidence of arm swelling and heaviness was 26.0% (95% CI 21.7–31.1%) and 30.9% (95% CI 26.3–36.3%), respectively. There was limited agreement between the two measurements (kappa 0.27) and between symptoms and measurements (kappa coefficients ranging from 0.05–0.09). Conclusions: Lymphedema incidence by limb volume and circumference gradually increased over 36 months post-surgery, whereas lymphedema symptoms were much lower. These findings underscore the importance of prospective surveillance and evaluation of both limb measurements and symptom assessment. Lymphedema incidence rates varied by definition. We recommend that ≥ 10% volume change criterion be used for lymphedema evaluation for referral for specialist care.

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were implanted into medullary canals of ovariectomized female athymic nude mice femurs (N = 8 mice/treatment). To examine the effect of E2 on osteolysis, mice were treated with 0.72 mg E2 or placebo via 60 day release osmotic pumps implanted subcutaneously. Legs were examined by Faxitron through the course of the study, and by microCT and histology after 8 weeks. Greater occurrence of osteolysis and pathologic fracture was observed in E2-treated animals compared to placebo, and microCT demonstrated less bone volume remaining in MDA-MB-231 treated legs compared to contralateral control legs, as well as E2-treated animals compared to placebo. E2-treated animals had significantly greater tumor volume compared to placebo. Large nests of anaplastic tumor cells with eroded cortical margin were observed in E2-treated animals compared to placebo.

Though its activity has been associated with tumor progression in various cancers, the expression pattern of this oncoprotein has been scarcely studied in breast cancer. In the current work, we analyzed its expression in a large cohort of breast cancer patients, revealing higher nuclear PRMT5 levels in ERα-positive tumors and an association with prolonged disease free and overall survival. Interestingly, high PRMT5 nuclear expression was also associated with higher nuclear liver kinase B1 (LKB1), suggesting that a functional relationship may occur. Consistently, several approaches provided evidence that PRMT5 and LKB1 interact directly in the cytoplasm of mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, although PRMT5 is not able to methylate LKB1, we found that PRMT5 is a bona fade substrate for LKB1. We identified T132, 139 and 144 residues, located in the TIM-Barrel domain of PRMT5, as target sites for LKB1 phosphorylation. The point mutation of PRMT5 T139/144 to A139/144 drastically decreased its methyltransferase activity, due probably to the loss of its interaction with regulatory proteins such as MEP50, pICln and RiOK1. In addition, modulation of LKB1 expression modified PRMT5 activity, highlighting a new regulatory mechanism that could have clinical implications. © 2018 The Authors.

We previously identified three patterns of fatigue and two patterns of disturbed sleep, depressed mood, and anxiety in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer using a Latent Growth Mixture Model. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore whether membership in symptom classes of fatigue, disturbed sleep, depressed mood, and anxiety is associated with other symptoms at moderate-to-severe levels. Methods: Using data from three longitudinal studies, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests for trend were used to distinguish between classes of women on co-occurring symptoms. Summative scores were calculated, including the number of days subjects reported moderate-to-severe levels (4 or higher on a 0–10 scale) of seven symptoms during two cycles of chemotherapy and compared to class membership. Results: Participants (n = 166) in the higher fatigue severity class reported more days with moderate-to-severe disturbed sleep, depressed mood, anxiety, nausea, and trouble thinking. Women in the higher severity disturbed sleep class reported more days with moderate-to-severe fatigue, depressed mood, anxiety, and trouble thinking. Women in the higher depressed mood severity class reported more days with moderate-to-severe fatigue, disturbed sleep, anxiety, and nausea. Women in the higher anxiety severity class reported more days with moderate-to-severe fatigue, disturbed sleep, and depressed mood.

Numerous states have enacted parity laws to limit patient cost-sharing for oral anticancer drugs. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of these laws on patient copayments for and adherence to oral endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Methods: Administrative health insurance claims data from 2007 to 2014 derived from a US health care database were used to identify female patients aged 18 to 64 years with invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast who initiated endocrine therapy and were enrolled in fully insured health plans in states that either enacted parity legislation between 2008 and 2013 or had not yet enacted such legislation by 2015. Differences-in-differences analysis was used to compare copayments for and adherence to endocrine therapy during the 1-year period before and after each year of legislation enactment. Results: In total, 6900 individuals who received 7778 unique drug therapy courses were identified. Parity legislation was associated with significant decreases in the 25th percentile of copayments for anastrozole of $4.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], −$4.52 to −$4.26; P <.001) and for exemestane of $3.08 (95% CI, −$4.80 to −$1.35; P <.001). The median copayment for exemestane decreased by $10.25 (95% CI, −$12.61 to −$7.89; P <.001). A higher median monthly copayment was significantly associated with a greater risk of medication nonadherence (adjusted risk ratio, 1.006 per dollar increase; P <.001). Conclusions: Parity laws had a modest effect on lowering the cost of anastrozole and exemestane, but more focused efforts to limit out-of-pocket costs for endocrine therapy may have a greater impact on medication adherence. © 2018 American Cancer Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85058853345

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 264 benign lesions and 390 luminal A breast cancers were automatically segmented from dynamic contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance images. Thirty-eight radiomic features were extracted. Tenfold cross validation was performed to assess the ability to distinguish between lesions and cancers using maximum linear size alone and lesion signatures obtained with stepwise feature selection and a linear discriminant analysis classifier including and excluding size features. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the figure of merit. Results: For maximum linear size alone, AUC and 95% confidence interval was 0.684 (0.642, 0.724) compared to 0.728 (0.687, 0.766) (P = 0.005) and 0.729 (0.689, 0.767) (P = 0.005) for lesion signature feature selection protocols including and excluding size features, respectively. The features of irregularity and entropy were chosen in all folds when size features were included and excluded. AUC for the radiomic signature using feature selection from all features was statistically equivalent to using feature selection from all features excluding size features, within an equivalence margin of 2%. Conclusions: Inclusion of multiple radiomic features, automatically extracted from magnetic resonance images, in a lesion signature significantly improved the ability to distinguish between benign lesions and luminal A breast cancers, compared to using maximum linear size alone.

Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed constitutive, fulvestrant-resistant, recruitment of ERα mutants to the Myc enhancer region, resulting in estrogen-independent Myc overexpression in mutant cells and tumors. Knockdown and virus transduction showed Myc is necessary and sufficient for ligand-independent proliferation of the mutant cells but had no effect on metastasis-related phenotypes.

This study examined concurrent and prospective relationships of SCs with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and depressive symptoms during the first year of breast cancer treatment. Methods: Nonmetastatic breast cancer patients (N = 240) enrolled in a larger intervention trial reported on the frequencies of SCs postsurgery (T1) and 6 months later (T2). HRQOL and depressive symptoms were assessed at T1, T2, and 12 months after T1 (T3). Path analysis via structural equation modeling was used to assess three models relating SCs to HRQOL and depressive symptoms from T1-T2, T1-T3, and T2-T3, controlling for stage of disease, intervention condition, and dispositional optimism. Results: Upward contrast SCs were associated with poorer concurrent HRQOL at T1 and T2, and with more concurrent depressive symptoms at T2. However, upward contrast SC at T1 predicted better T2 and T3 HRQOL. Upward identification SC at T1 predicted more T2 depressive symptoms, and at T2 was associated with poorer concurrent HRQOL and more concurrent depressive symptoms. Downward identification SCs at T1 were associated with poorer concurrent HRQOL. Downward identification SCs at T2 predicted poorer T3 HRQOL. Conclusions: Upward SCs were related to compromised concurrent psychosocial well-being, but prospective effects varied by the interpretation of the comparison (ie, contrast vs identification).

Trebananib plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel was evaluated in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive breast cancer in an open-label phase 1b clinical study. Patients and Methods: Women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive breast cancer received weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m 2 ), trastuzumab (8 mg/m 2 then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks), and intravenous trebananib (10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg weekly) beginning week 2. The primary end point was the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary end points included incidence of adverse events (AEs), pharmacokinetics, and tumor response (objective response and duration of response). Results: Forty women were enrolled; 2 experienced dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 ocular transient ischemic attack [10 mg/kg cohort] and grade 3 elevation in γ-glutamyl transferase [30 mg/kg cohort]). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were peripheral edema (n = 28), diarrhea (n = 27), alopecia (n = 26), fatigue (n = 24), and nausea (n = 24).

Data Source: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database from 2009-2013. Study Design: The proportion of variation in monthly medical spending within geographic region attributed to patient and physician factors was estimated using multilevel regression models with individual patient and physician random effects. Using sequential models, we estimated the contribution of differences in patient and disease characteristics or use of cancer treatment modalities to patient-level and physician-level variance in spending. Services associated with high spending physicians were estimated using linear regression. Data Extraction Method: A total of 20 818 women with a breast cancer diagnosis in 2010-2011. Principal Findings: We observed substantial between-patient and between-provider variation in spending following diagnosis and at the end-of-life. Immediately following diagnosis, 48% of between-patient and 31% of between-physician variation were driven by differences in delivery of cancer treatment modalities to similar patients. At the end-of-life, patients of high spending physicians had twice as many inpatient days, double the chemotherapy spending, and slightly more hospice days.

However, the impact of diet and physical inactivity on the risk of breast cancer (BC) is understudied, and the limited findings are controversial. In addition, no or limited knowledge is available from the developing world. Patients and Methods: This case-control study was performed from November 2014 to March 2016 on 1010 young women aged 20 to 50 years who were newly diagnosed with BC. Data was obtained via a validated questionnaire and the global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ2). Also, patients’ medical and histopathology reports were reviewed. Results: The results of multiple logistic regression suggested that, except for the common risk factors for BC (older marital age, family history of BC, smoking, and being a passive smoker), eating red meat (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] >8 portions/week [p/w] vs. 0-2 p/w, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.28); eating fish (aOR >8 p/w vs. 0-2 p/w, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.76), fruit consumption (aOR 0-4 p/w vs. >8 p/w, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.07-3.82), pickle consumption (aOR >8 p/w vs. 7-8 p/w, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31-1.70), and intensity of physical activity (aOR light vs. vigorous, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.47-1.98) were directly associated with a higher risk of BC in young women. Conclusion: Our study supported the hypothesis that unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity are risk factors for BC. We found that a healthy diet containing low fat and high fruits and vegetables with regular exercise are effective ways to reduce the risk of BC among young women. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057423368

Currently available molecular signatures assess the risk of recurrence and the benefit of chemotherapy; however, these tests may have large intermediate risk groups, limiting their usefulness. Methods: The EarlyR prognostic score was developed using integrative analysis of microarray data sets and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded–based quantitative real-time PCR assay and validated in Affymetrix data sets and METABRIC cohort using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Concordance index was used to measure the probability of prognostic score agreement with outcome. Results: The EarlyR score and categorical risk strata (EarlyR-Low, EarlyR-Int, EarlyR-High) derived from expression of ESPL1, MKI67, SPAG5, PLK1 and PGR was prognostic of 8-year distant recurrence-free interval in Affymetrix (categorical P = 3.5 × 10 −14 ; continuous P = 8.8 × 10 −15 ) and METABRIC (categorical P &lt; 2.2 × 10 −16 ; continuous P &lt; 10 −16 ) data sets of ER + breast cancer. Similar results were observed for the breast cancer–free interval end point. At most 13% of patients were intermediate risk and at least 66% patients were low risk in both ER + cohorts. The EarlyR score was significantly prognostic (distant recurrence-free interval; P &lt;.001) in both lymph node–negative and lymph node–positive patients and was independent from clinical factors. EarlyR and surrogates of current molecular signatures were comparable in prognostic significance by concordance index. Conclusion: The 5-gene EarlyR score is a robust prognostic assay that identified significantly fewer patients as intermediate risk and more as low risk than currently available assays. Further validation of the assay in clinical trial–derived cohorts is ongoing. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85050999174

In preclinical studies, additional mechanisms of eribulin included reversal of epithelial mesenchymal transition and tumor vascular remodeling. The present study compared the safety and efficacy of eribulin plus cyclophosphamide (ErC) to docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (TC) as neoadjuvant therapy for operable HER2 − breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Women with invasive HER2 − breast adenocarcinoma with no distant metastases were eligible. After a 10-patient safety lead-in, the patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ErC (eribulin 1.4 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 on day 1) or TC (docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 on day 1) administered every 21 days for 6 cycles, followed by surgery. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was the primary endpoint. Tumor samples collected at baseline and at surgery were assayed for select epithelial mesenchymal transition and vascular density markers: E-cadherin, vimentin, and CD31 expression. Results: A total of 76 patients were enrolled. Of the 76 patients, 10 received ErC in the lead-in phase and 66 were randomized to ErC (n = 44) or TC (n = 22). The pCR rates with ErC and TC were 13% and 9%, respectively. Both regimens produced frequent neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy. Both regimens increased vascular density as measured by CD31 staining. Conclusion: The neoadjuvant regimens of ErC and TC resulted in relatively low pCR rates in this patient population.

Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved prospective study included 38 women (median age, 46.5 years; range, 25-70 years) with breast cancer who were scheduled for NAC and underwent mpMRI of the breast at 3 T with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and T2-weighted imaging before and after 2 cycles of NAC. For each lesion, 23 features were extracted: qualitative T2-weighted and DCE-MRI features according to BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System), quantitative pharmacokinetic DCE features (mean plasma flow, volume distribution, mean transit time), and DWI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. To apply machine learning to mpMRI, 8 classifiers including linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, decision tree, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to rank the features. Histopathologic residual cancer burden (RCB) class (with RCB 0 being a pCR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were used as the standards of reference. Classification accuracy with area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) was assessed using all the extracted qualitative and quantitative features for pCR as defined by RCB class, RFS, and DSS using recursive feature elimination. To overcome overfitting, 4-fold cross-validation was used. Results Machine learning with mpMRI achieved stable performance as shown by mean classification accuracies for the prediction of RCB class (AUC, 0.86) and DSS (AUC, 0.92) based on XGBoost and the prediction of RFS (AUC, 0.83) with logistic regression. The XGBoost classifier achieved the most stable performance with high accuracies compared with other classifiers. The most relevant features for the prediction of RCB class were as follows: changes in lesion size, complete pattern of shrinkage, and mean transit time on DCE-MRI; minimum ADC on DWI; and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted imaging. The most relevant features for prediction of RFS were as follows: volume distribution, mean plasma flow, and mean transit time; DCE-MRI lesion size; minimum, maximum, and mean ADC with DWI. The most relevant features for prediction of DSS were as follows: lesion size, volume distribution, and mean plasma flow on DCE-MRI, and maximum ADC with DWI. Conclusions Machine learning with mpMRI of the breast enables early prediction of pCR to NAC as well as survival outcomes in breast cancer patients with high accuracy and thus may provide valuable predictive information to guide treatment decisions. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The HBEC model includes Type I HBECs (normal stem), Type II HBECs (normal differentiated) and transformed cells (immortal/non-tumorigenic cells and tumorigenic cells, which are transformed from the same parental normal stem cells). The results of the present study indicate that sphingosine preferentially inhibits proliferation and causes death of normal stem cells (Type I), tumorigenic cells, and MCF7 breast cancer cells, but not normal differentiated cells (Type II). In contrast to the selective anti-proliferative effects of sphingosine, C 2 -ceramide inhibits proliferation of normal differentiated cells as well as normal stem cells, tumorigenic cells, and MCF7 cancer cells with similar potency. Both sphingosine and C 2 -ceramide induce apoptosis in tumorigenic cells. Among the sphingosine stereoisomers (D-erythro, D-threo, L-erythro, and L-threo) and sphinganine that were tested, L-erythro-sphingosine most potently inhibits proliferation of tumorigenic cells. The inhibition of breast tumorigenic/cancer cell proliferation by sphingosine was accompanied by inhibition of telomerase activity. Sphingosine at non-cytotoxic concentrations, but not C 2 -ceramide, induces differentiation of normal stem cells (Type I), thereby reducing the number of stem cells that are more susceptible to neoplastic transformation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrates one of the first results that sphingosine can be a potential chemotherapeutic and cancer-protective agent, whereas C 2 -ceramide is not an ideal chemotherapeutic and cancer-protective agent due to its anti-proliferative effects on Type II HBECs and its inability to induce the differentiation of Type I to Type II HBECs. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Human triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 cells) is known to have a high percentage of apoptotic (P53) deficient cells and some patients can have poor outcomes with current treatments. Objectives: Previously, we reported a strong upregulation of the apoptotic arm of the unfolded protein response, via reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), as well as positive annexin staining in this human breast carcinoma, when grown in media prepared with BFA’s dc DEP-EMF treated saline. Here we will examine and discuss cytoskeletal microtubule changes that were noted in the treated breast carcinoma that are strongly suggestive of apoptosis and the possible correlation of these microtubule changes to the upregulation of Junction Mediating and Regulatory Protein (JMY, a P53/TP53 cofactor) that is known to drive cytoskeleton microfilaments (actin) function. Methods: In addition to microarray and RT-qPCR analyses, we conducted 7 days of fluorescent microscopic analyses of tubulin assays in these treated versus control MDA-MB-231 cells. Results: These data suggest 2 possible forms of apoptosis, rounded and irregular, may be occurring and possibly facilitated by the significant upregulation (via microarray and RT-qPCR) of an important but poorly understood Nucleation-Promoting Factor (NPF), JMY. Conclusions: The ability of the BFA dc DEP-EMF to significantly upregulate JMY and possibly influence the regulation of unbranched (nucleation-microtubule spikes) and branched forms (autophagy) of actin in the cytoplasmic domains may facilitate a “two coffins” or round and irregular necrosis-like apoptosis for this highly aggressive and often apoptotic-deficient breast cancer cell line. © The Author(s) 2019.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062295098

Participants underwent FNA of the clipped node before seed-localized lymph node excision. FNA pathology was compared with surgical pathology. Results: There were 36 patients (72%) with residual disease on surgical pathology: 3 (8%) had a nondiagnostic aspirate, carcinoma was seen in 14 (39%), and 19 (53%) had a false-negative result. The sensitivity of FNA was 42.4%, its specificity was 100%, and its negative predictive value was 40.6%. In a univariate analysis, the odds of a true-positive result increased significantly with the mean initial size of the clipped node (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; P =.004) and the size of the metastatic focus after NAC (OR, 1.3; P = 0.003), whereas normalization of nodes after chemotherapy (OR, 0.1) and a lack of response on ultrasound (OR, 0.11) were associated with a false-negative result (P =.01). Conclusions: FNA of marked nodes after chemotherapy has a high false-negative rate. This highlights the need for surgical staging of the axilla after NAC to assess the response. © 2018 American Cancer Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85055570607

The aim of our study was to discover and characterize the function of yet functionally uncharacterized microRNAs in human breast carcinogenesis. Methods: In an unbiased approach, we utilized an established model system for breast cancer (BC) stem cell formation (""mammosphere assay"") to identify whole miRNome alterations in breast carcinogenesis. Clinical samples of BC patients were used to evaluate the human relevance of the newly identified miRNA candidates. One promising candidate, miR-1287-5p, was further explored on its impact on several hallmarks of cancer. The molecular mode of action was characterized by whole transcriptome analysis, in silico prediction tools, miRNA-interaction assays, pheno-copy assays, and drug sensitivity assays. Results: Among several other microRNAs, miR-1287-5p was significantly downregulated in mammospheres and human BC tissue compared to normal breast tissue (p < 0.0001). Low expression levels were significantly associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. MiR-1287-5p significantly decreased cellular growth, cells in S phase of cell cycle, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation in vivo. In addition, we identified PIK3CB as a direct molecular interactor of miR-1287-5p and a novel prognostic factor in BC. Finally, PI3Kinase pathway chemical inhibitors combined with miR-1287-5p mimic increased the pharmacological growth inhibitory potential in triple negative BC cells. Conclusion: Our data identified for the first time the involvement of miR-1287-5p in human BC and suggest a potential for therapeutic interventions in difficult to treat triple negative BC. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",,2-s2.0-85060931763

Protective buffering inhibits self-disclosure and is defined as efforts to protect one's partner from upset and burden by hiding or denying cancer-related concerns. Intimacy and fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) are important determinants of individual and couple adaptation following cancer. Links between protective buffering and intimacy have not been examined in the context of daily life, and links with FCR have not been studied. We hypothesized that protective buffering is associated with decreased intimacy and increased FCR at a daily, within-person level. Methods: Sixty-nine early-stage breast cancer (BC) survivors and their spouses completed electronic diaries for 21 consecutive days at the end of adjuvant treatment. Patients and spouses reported on daily protective buffering, intimacy, and FCR. Dyadic multilevel path modeling was used to estimate within-person effects. Patient and spouse protective buffering on one's own as well as one's partner's same-day intimacy and FCR were examined, controlling for previous levels of intimacy and FCR. Results: Protective buffering was associated with decreased intimacy and increased FCR for the individual reporting buffering that same day. Patient and spouse protective buffering was also linked to decreased intimacy for her/his partner that same day. Moreover, patient protective buffering predicted increased spouse FCR that same day. Conclusions: Findings supported a daily, within-person link between buffering, intimacy, and FCR, suggesting open disclosure of cancer-related concerns may be a relevant target for interventions for adaptation to BC. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058064052

The objective of this study was to quantify the inflation of type I error rates that can result from differential outcome misclassification. Methods: We used data on gold-standard and EHR-derived second breast cancers in a cohort of women with a prior breast cancer diagnosis from 1993 to 2006 enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Washington. We simulated an exposure that was independent of the true outcome status. A surrogate outcome was then simulated with varying sensitivity and specificity according to exposure status. We estimated the type I error rate for a test of association relating this exposure to the surrogate outcome, while varying outcome sensitivity and specificity in exposed individuals. Results: Type I error rates were substantially inflated above the nominal level (5%) for even modest departures from nondifferential misclassification. Holding sensitivity in exposed and unexposed groups at 85%, a difference in specificity of 10% between the exposed and unexposed (80% vs 90%) resulted in a 36% type I error rate. Type I error was inflated more by differential specificity than sensitivity. Conclusions: Differential outcome misclassification may induce spurious findings. Researchers using EHR-derived outcomes should use misclassification-adjusted methods whenever possible or conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the possibility of false-positive findings, especially for exposures that may be related to the accuracy of outcome ascertainment. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055699625

Understanding the underlying mechanisms that regulate progression of basal-like breast cancers would lead to new therapeutic targets and improved treatment strategies. Breast cancer progression is characterized by inflammatory responses, regulated in part by chemokines. The CCL2/CCR2 chemokine pathway is best known for regulating breast cancer progression through macrophage-dependent mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated important biological roles for CCL2/CCR2 signaling in breast cancer cells. Using the MCF10CA1d xenograft model of basal-like breast cancer, primary tumor growth was significantly increased with cotransplantation of patient-derived fibroblasts expressing high levels of CCL2, and was inhibited with CRISP/R gene ablation of stromal CCL2. CRISP/R gene ablation of CCR2 in MCF10CA1d breast cancer cells inhibited breast tumor growth and M2 macrophage recruitment and validated through CCR2 shRNA knockdown in the 4T1 model. Reverse phase protein array analysis revealed that cell-cycle protein expression was associated with CCR2 expression in basal-like breast cancer cells. CCL2 treatment of basal-like breast cancer cell lines increased proliferation and cell-cycle progression associated with SRC and PKC activation. Through pharmacologic approaches, we demonstrated that SRC and PKC negatively regulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor protein p27KIP1, and are necessary for CCL2-induced breast cancer cell proliferation. Implications: This report sheds novel light on CCL2/ CCR2 chemokine signaling as a mitogenic pathway and cell-cycle regulator in breast cancer cells. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060918660

We studied the clinical and pathological characteristics in YWBC and examined how outcomes and treatment have evolved. Methods: YWBC were identified from pathology databases at two tertiary centers. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those diagnosed from 2000 to 2005 (C1) and from 2006 to 2015 (C2). Data were retrieved from clinical, radiology, and histology databases. Statistical analysis was performed using R® (V3.2.0). Results: We identified 345 patients. Median age was 36 years (23–39 years). Mastectomy was performed in 232 patients (67.2%) and axillary lymph node clearance (ALNC) in 207 patients (60% [C1 82.7 vs. C2: 49.4%, p < 0.001]). One hundred-seventy patients (49%) were ER + HER2−, 88 (25.5%) were HER2+, and 58 (16.8%) were triple negative. Eighty patients (23.2%) received neoadjuvant therapy. Pathological complete response rates were statistically similar between C1 and C2 [C1 1 (0.9%) vs C2 16 (6.8%) p = 0.1]. Distant relapse occurred in 59 (19%) patients. There was a higher relapse rate (RR) in C1 [27 (32.1%) vs. 32 (15.7%), p < 0.002). HER2+ and ER+ HER2− patients in C1 had higher RRs than C2. Median overall survival in patients with metastatic disease was 29 months (range 2–119 months). Conclusion: Locally advanced disease was more prevalent in YWBC.

Health status and quality of life among survivors are variable, and African American (AA) survivors suffer disproportionately from BrCa morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that peer support is an effective strategy to promote positive survivorship outcomes for AA BrCa survivors. This study aimed to explore the role of peer support in the BrCa experiences of AA survivors. Methods: Working collaboratively with The Breakfast Club, Inc. (BCI), a community-based BrCa peer support organization, we conducted a quasiexperiment to compare the BrCa experiences of AA survivors. We conducted in-depth interviews with two survivor groups (N = 12 per group), categorized according to receiving peer support during their BrCa experiences. Results: Survivors who received peer support reported greater access to and utilization of alternative support sources, more capacity to process BrCa-related stress, and improved quality of life and adjustment to life as BrCa survivors compared with those who did not receive peer support. Conclusions: Peer relationships provide consistent, quality social support. Consistent peer support helps survivors cope with the continued stress of BrCa, with implications for psychosocial health and quality of life.

We sought to analyze long-term outcomes and characterize potential prognostic factors, in women with breast cancer (BC) oligometastases treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiation (HSRT) therapy on a prospective phase II protocol. Methods: Forty-eight women with 1–5 extracranial BC oligometastases received HSRT to all radiographically apparent sites of disease. Various dose-fractionation schedules were used. Most (n = 27) received 10 daily fractions, typically ≥50 Gy (n = 17). Results: BC patients with bone-only oligometastases (BO, n = 12) vs. all other patients (non-BO; n = 36) were significantly younger, more likely to present with oligometastases at the time of primary BC diagnosis (i.e., synchronous), and significantly more likely to have had hormone receptor-positive disease. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates after HSRT were 83% and 75%, respectively, for BO patients vs. 31% and 17%, respectively, for non-BO patients (p = 0.002). BO patients experienced a significantly (p = 0.018) greater freedom from widespread metastases (FFWM). Among non-BO patients, net oligometastatic GTV >25 cc (reflecting disease burden) was a significant factor for freedom from local recurrence (p = 0.047) and FFWM (p = 0.028). The number of oligometastatic lesions (p = 0.007) and organs (p = 0.001) involved were also significant factors for FFWM in non-BO patients. Conclusions: Some patients with BC oligometastases treated with HSRT can survive >10 years. Tumor burden (volume and number of lesions) appears to impact risk of recurrence.

Palbociclib has proven benefits in phase III placebo-controlled studies; however, real-world outcome data are lacking. The Ibrance Real World Insights (IRIS) study evaluated palbociclib use in patients with HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC in the real-world setting in the US, Argentina, and Germany. Here we describe results for the US patient subgroup. Patients and methods: IRIS was a retrospective medical chart review study of patients with confirmed HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC who received palbociclib with either an aromatase inhibitor (AI) as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women or fulvestrant-based therapy in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. Physicians extracted data from patient medical records for ≤16 sequential patients each. Outcomes included progression-free and survival rates. Results: Records were extracted for 652 patients: 360 (55.2%) treated with palbociclib + AI and 292 (44.8%) treated with palbociclib + fulvestrant. The 12-month progression-free rate was 84.1% for patients treated with palbociclib + AI and 79.8% for those treated with palbociclib + fulvestrant; 12-month survival rates were 95.1% for palbociclib + AI and 87.9% for palbociclib + fulvestrant. Conclusion: In this first real-world assessment of clinical outcomes in US patients with HR+/HER- ABC/MBC, treatment with palbociclib in combination with AI or fulvestrant demonstrated favorable effectiveness in terms of progression-free and survival rates. Ongoing studies are needed to deliver mature clinical outcome data beyond 12/24 months in the real-world setting. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85057148547

This study aimed to investigate the association between a Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI) score and BC risk among Moroccan women. Methods: In this case–control study, 300 incident BC cases and 300 controls, matched by age and area of residence were recruited. Cases were women newly-diagnosed with histopathologically–confirmed BC at the University Hospital in Fez, Morocco. Controls were randomly selected healthy women recruited from 6 primary health centers in Fez. HLI scores developed within this study were assigned to participants based on 11 factors (red and processed meat, white meat, cream, cheese, fish, fruit and vegetables, physical activity, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and breastfeeding), where 0 was given to unhealthy and 0.5 or 1 to healthy levels of each factor. Conditional and unconditional logistic regression models were used to assess the association between HLI scores and BC risk. Results: Mean of HLI scores were 8.1 (±1.1) and 9.0 (±0.9) in cases and controls, respectively, p < 0.01. After adjusting for potential confounders, one-point increment in the HLI score was associated with 56% (95% CI, CI: 39–68%), 49% (95% CI: 30–63%), and 59% (95% CI: 40–72%) lower risks of BC in all, premenopausal, and postmenopausal women, respectively. Conclusion: High HLI scores were associated with decreased risk of BC in Moroccan women. These findings suggest that BC prevention policies should include strategies for engaging Moroccan women in healthy lifestyles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85059170909

To improve the outcome of patients with BrCa bone metastasis, we need to understand better the mechanisms underlying bone metastasis. Researchers have relied heavily upon in vivo xenografts due to limited availability of human bone metastasis samples. A significant limitation of these is that they do not have a human bone microenvironment. To address this issue, we have developed a nanoclay-based 3D in vitro model of BrCa bone metastasis using human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human BrCa cells mimicking late stage of BrCa pathogenesis at the metastatic site. This 3D model can provide a microenvironment suitable for cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions whilst retaining the behaviour of BrCa cells with different metastasis potential (i.e., highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and low metastatic MCF-7) as shown by the production of alkaline phosphatase and matrix metalloproteinase-9. The sequential culture of MSCs with MCF-7 exhibited 3D tumouroids formation and also occurrence of mesenchymal to epithelial transition of cancer metastasis as evidenced by gene expression and immunocytochemistry. The unique and distinct behaviour of highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and the low metastatic MCF-7 was observed at the bone metastasis site. The changes to migratory capabilities and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 in comparison with tumour growth with MCF-7 was observed. Together, a novel bone-mimetic 3D in vitro BrCa model has been developed that could be used to study mechanisms governing the later stage of cancer pathogenesis in bone. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059624812

Methods: We used data from the population-based California Cancer Registry for 38,509 younger (18-49 years) and 121,573 older (50 years and older) women diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer, 2005-2014. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate breast cancer-specific mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), stratified by tumor subtype, guideline treatment, and care at an NCI-designated cancer center (NCICC). Results: Older breast cancer patients at diagnosis experienced 17% higher disease-specific mortality than younger patients, after multivariable adjustment (MRR ¼ 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.23). Higher MRRs (95% CI) were observed for older versus younger patients with hormone receptor (HR) þ /HER2 - (1.24; 1.14-1.35) and HR þ /HER2 þ (1.38; 1.17-1.62), but not for HR - /HER2 þ (HR ¼ 0.94; 0.79-1.12) nor triple-negative breast cancers (1.01; 0.92-1.11). The higher mortality in older versus younger patients was diminished among patients who received guideline-concordant treatment (MRR ¼ 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.14) and reversed among those seen at an NCICC (MRR ¼ 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73-1.01). Conclusions: Although younger women tend to be diagnosed with more aggressive breast cancers, adjusting for these aggressive features results in older patients having higher mortality than younger patients, with variations by age, tumor subtype, receipt of guideline treatment, and being cared for at an NCICC. Impact: Higher breast cancer mortality in older compared with younger women could partly be addressed by ensuring optimal treatment and comprehensive patient-centered care. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061028263

It may be a therapeutic target due to its unique expression in cancer cells. Methods: We estimated the association between nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression in primary tumors and breast cancer recurrence. In this case-control study, we included women age 35–69, diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer between 1985 and 2001, and registered with the Danish Breast Cancer Group. We identified 541 patients with breast cancer recurrence with estrogen receptor–positive disease who were treated with tamoxifen for at least 1 year (ER+/TAM+) and 300 with estrogen receptor–negative carcinomas, not treated with tamoxifen, and who survived at least 1 year (ER−/TAM−). Controls were matched to cases on ER/TAM status, date of surgery, menopausal status, stage and county. Survivin expression was estimated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We fit logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associating nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression with recurrence. Results: Associations between nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression and breast cancer recurrence were near-null in both ER+/TAM + and ER−/TAM − strata. For the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio (CNR) of survivin expression, we found a null association in the ER+/TAM + group comparing CNR ≥5 with CNR <5, but an association (OR =2.48, 95% CI: 1.15, 5.31) in the ER−/TAM − group. Conclusions: Survivin expression was not associated with breast cancer recurrence in this study. The CNR ratio may warrant further investigation especially among ER − tumors. © 2018, © 2018 Acta Oncologica Foundation.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061964255

Purpose: Describe the design and participant characteristics of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the survivorship care plan on reproductive health (SCP-R) intervention on improving hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception in YBCS. Methods: SCP-R is a web-based intervention with text message support encompassing evidence- based practices on four reproductive health issues. YBCS with ≥1 reproductive health issue are randomized to intervention (full SCP-R access) or attention control (access to list of online resources) arms with 24-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be improvement of at least one reproductive health issue measured by validated self-report instruments. Each YBCS nominated one healthcare provider (HCP), who can access the same materials as their patient. HCP outcomes are preparedness and confidence in discussing each issue. Results: Among 318 YBCS screened, 57.2% underwent randomization. Mean age was 40.0 (SD 5.9), and mean age at cancer diagnosis was 35.6 (SD 5.4). Significant hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, vaginal symptoms, and inadequate contraception were reported by 50.5%, 50%, 46.7%, 62.1% of YBCS, respectively; 70.9% had multiple issues. Among 165 nominated HCPs, 32.7% enrolled. The majority of HCPs reported preparedness (68.5–90.7%) and confidence (50.0–74.1%) in discussing reproductive health issues with YBCS. HCPs were least likely to report preparedness or confidence in discussing fertility-related concerns.

Primarily used in clinical setting, auto-segmentation plays an increasing role in research, particularly when analyzing thousands of images in the “big data” era. In this study we evaluate the accuracy of cardiac dosimetric endpoints derived from atlas based auto-segmentation compared to gold standard manual segmentation. Material and methods: Heart and cardiac substructures were manually delineated on 54 breast cancer patients. Twenty-seven patients were used to build the auto-segmentation atlas, the other 27 to validate performance. We evaluated accuracy of the auto-segmented contours with standard geometric indices and assessed dosimetric endpoints. Results: Auto-segmented contours overlapped geometrically with manual contours of the heart and chambers with Dice-similarity coefficients of 0.93 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard deviation) and 0.79 ± 0.07 respectively. Similarly, there was a strong link between dosimetric parameters derived from auto-segmented and manual contours (R 2 = 0.955–1.000). On the other hand, the left anterior descending artery had little geometric overlap (Dice-similarity coefficient 0.09 ± 0.07), though acceptable representation of dosimetric parameters (R 2 = 0.646–0.992). Conclusions: The atlas based auto-segmentation approach delineates heart structures with sufficient accuracy for research purposes.

The ability of EarlyR to predict pathological complete response (pCR) and long-term survival following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is evaluated herein. Materials: The ability of EarlyR gene signature to predict pCR was assessed in publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets (Cohort A; n = 659; 74 pCR events) derived from NACT-treated ER+ BC patients. Distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) results were analyzed in patients treated with NACT and adjuvant hormone therapy (AHT) (n = 281) and compared with patients treated with AHT alone (n = 455) (Cohort B; n = 736; 142 events). Results: In cohort A, EarlyR was a significant predictor of pCR (p = 5.8 × 10 −11 ) (EarlyR-Low, n = 400, pCR = 40, 5%; EarlyR-Int, n = 69, pCR = 7, 15% and EarlyR-High, n = 190, pCR = 47, 24%). In EarlyR-Low of Cohort B, the 5-year DRFS was not significantly (p = 0.55) different between NACT + AHT [0.81 (95%CI 0.73–0.90)] and AHT-only [0.85 (95%CI 0.81–0.90)]. In contrast, in EarlyR-High, the 5-year DRFS was higher (p = 0.019) in NACT + AHT [0.81 (95%CI 0.70–0.93)] as compared to AHT-only [0.60 (95%CI 0.51–0.71)]. Conclusions: High EarlyR is strongly associated with pCR in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EarlyR also predicts poor DRFS outcomes for patients in EarlyR-High not receiving NACT, and improved survival in NACT-treated EarlyR-High patients. EarlyR is not only a prognostic assay but also a predictive assay that identifies patients, who are also likely to respond to chemotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85059317960

Methods: Data from 1967 consecutive breast radiotherapy (RT) courses at one institution between 2008 and 2015 were automatically extracted from EMRs and oncology information systems using extraction software. Over 230 variables were extracted spanning the following variable segments: patient demographics, medical/surgical history, tumor characteristics, RT treatment history, and AEs tracked using CTCAEv4.0. Treatment failure was extracted algorithmically by searching posttreatment encounters for evidence of local, nodal, or distant failure. Individual models were trained using decision trees, logistic regression, random forests, and boosted decision trees to predict treatment failures and AEs. Models were fit on 75% of the data and evaluated for probability calibration and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on the remaining test set. The impact of each variable segment was assessed by retraining without the segment and measuring change in AUC (ΔAUC). Results: All AUC values were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Ensemble methods outperformed single-model methods across all outcomes. The best ensemble method outperformed decision trees and logistic regression by an average AUC of 0.053 and 0.034, respectively. Model probabilities were well calibrated as evidenced by calibration curves. Excluding the patient medical history variable segment led to the largest AUC reduction in all models (Average ΔAUC = −0.025), followed by RT treatment history (−0.021) and tumor information (−0.015). Conclusion: In this largest such study in breast cancer performed to date, automatically extracted EMR data provided a basis for reliable outcome predictions across multiple statistical methods. Ensemble methods provided substantial advantages over single-model methods.

Methods and Results: Eighty-two arms of 41 patients with BCRL were included. Mean age was 56.05 (8.16) years and all stages of lymphedema were equally included. Fifteen sessions of CDT was applied to all patients. The calculated volume of extremities, the quality of life (cancer adaptation of Ferrans-Powell), neuropathic pain (NP; Douleur Neuropathique 4), and disability (quick disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand [Q-DASH]) tests were recorded before and after therapy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue thicknesses of volar and dorsal sides and median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the level of carpal tunnel were measured using ultrasonography (US), before and after therapy. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS; 41.37%) and polyneuropathy (10.34%) were common findings confirmed by electromyography. Neuropathic pain profile was also found in 34.14% of patients. The arm volume of affected side, quality of life, and skin and subcutaneous tissue thicknesses were improved after therapy (p < 0.05). However, median nerve CSA, the NP, and Q-DASH scores were not changed after therapy. Conclusions: Although lymphedema is a painless condition, NP and CTS should not be ignored in patients with BCRL. US is an alternative, precise, and high technological method for evaluating treatment response. CDT is an effective and safe treatment according to volumetric calculations, US measurements of tissue thicknesses, and median nerve size. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061595411

Data Sources: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked dataset. Study Design: Applying social network theory, we constructed physician peer groups for patients with breast cancer. Under different assumptions of key parameter values—minimum patient volume for physician inclusion and minimum number of patients shared between physicians for a connection—we compared agreement in group membership between split samples during 2004-2006 (T1) (reliability) and agreement in group membership between T1 and 2007-2009 (T2) (stability). We also compared the results with those derived from randomly generated groups and to hospital affiliation-based groups. Principal Findings: The sample included 142 098 patients treated by 43 174 physicians in T1 and 136 680 patients treated by 51 515 physicians in T2. We identified parameter values that resulted in a median peer group reliability of 85.2 percent (Interquartile range (IQR) [0 percent, 96.2 percent]) and median stability of 73.7 percent (IQR [0 percent, 91.0 percent]). In contrast, stability of randomly assigned peer groups was 6.2 percent (IQR [0 percent, 21.0 percent]). Median overlap of empirical groups with hospital groups was 32.2 percent (IQR [12.1 percent, 59.2 percent]). Conclusions: It is feasible to construct physician peer groups that are reliable, stable, and distinct from both randomly generated and hospital-based groups. © Health Research and Educational Trust","Final",,2-s2.0-85057446806

We hypothesized that integrating immune-related genomic signatures with clinicopathologic factors may yield a predictive accuracy exceeding that of the currently available system. Methods: Ten signatures that reflect specific immunogenic or immune microenvironmental features of TNBC were identified and re-analyzed using bioinformatic methods. Then, clinically annotated TNBC (n = 711) with the corresponding expression profiles, which predicted a patient's probability of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), was pooled to evaluate their prognostic values and establish a clinicopathologic-genomic nomogram. Three and two immune features were, respectively, selected out of 10 immune features to construct nomogram for DFS and OS prediction based on multivariate backward stepwise Cox regression analyses. Results: By integrating the above immune expression signatures with prognostic clinicopathologic features, clinicopathologic-genomic nomograms were cautiously constructed, which showed reasonable prediction accuracies (DFS: HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.46-2.18, P < 0.001; AUC, 0.71; OS: HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.54-2.49; P < 0.001; AUC, 0.73). The nomogram showed low-risk subgroup had higher immune checkpoint molecules (PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3) expression and benefited from radiotherapy (HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.05-0.89; P = 0.034) rather than chemotherapy (HR, 1.26, 95% CI, 0.66-2.43; P = 0.485). Conclusions: These findings offer evidence that immune-related genomic data provide independent and complementary prognostic information for TNBC, and the nomogram might be a practical predictive tool to identify TNBC patients who would benefit from chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and upcoming popularity of immunotherapy. © 2019 The Authors.

This prospective observational study assessed patient-related, perioperative, and genetic risk factors for severe acute pain and persistent pain following breast cancer surgery. METHODS: Women presenting for elective breast cancer surgery completed State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale questionnaires preoperatively. Diffuse noxious inhibitory control and mechanical temporal summation were assessed. A blood sample was obtained for genetic analysis. Analgesic consumption and pain scores were collected in the post-anesthesia care unit, and at 24 and 72 hours. Patients were contacted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to assess persistent pain. Primary outcome was maximum acute pain score in first 72 hours and secondary outcome was persistent pain. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were included in analysis. Increased duration of surgery, surgeon, and higher pain catastrophizing scores were associated with increased severity of acute pain, while preoperative radiotherapy was associated with reduced severity. Persistent pain was reported by 57.3% of patients. Postdischarge chemotherapy (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.82), postdischarge radiation (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.24 to 10.41), severe acute pain (OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.03 to 15.54), and moderate acute pain (OR 5.31, 95% CI 1.99 to 15.30) were associated with increased likelihood of persistent pain. CONCLUSIONS: Increased duration of surgery, higher pain catastrophizing score, and surgeon were associated with increased severity of acute pain. Preoperative radiation was associated with lower acute pain scores. Postsurgery radiation, chemotherapy, and severity of acute pain were associated with increased likelihood of persistent pain.

In the delivery of oncology care, the barriers to and facilitators of communication about potential long-term and late effects, post-treatment expectations, and transition to survivorship care have not been fully defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: We collected qualitative data through semistructured interviews with medical oncologists and focus groups with breast cancer survivors and applied the Theoretical Domains Framework to systematically analyze and identify the factors that may influence oncologists' communication with patients with breast cancer about the long-term and late effects of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS:: Eight key informant interviews with medical oncologists and two focus groups with breast cancer survivors provided data. Both oncologists and patients perceived information on long-term effects as valuable in terms of improved clinical communication but had concerns about the feasibility of inclusion before treatment. They described the current approaches to communication of therapy risks as a brief laundry list that emphasized acute adverse effects and minimized more long-term issues. We describe the barriers to communication about potential long-term effects from the perspectives of both groups. CONCLUSION:: This study provides insight into oncologists' communication with patients with breast cancer regarding the potential long-term and late effects of adjuvant chemotherapy and about setting realistic expectations for life after treatment. Opportunities to improve oncologists' communication about the potential toxicities of therapy, particularly regarding long-term and late effects, should be examined further.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061615607

However, the effects of continuous TKI exposure on cell fate, and the steps leading to the acquisition of a resistant phenotype are poorly understood. To explore this, we exposed five HER2 positive cells lines to HER2 targeted therapies for periods of up to 4 weeks and examined senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity together with additional markers of senescence. We found that lapatinib treatment resulted in phenotypic alterations consistent with a senescent phenotype and strong SA-β-gal activity in HER2-positive cell lines. Lapatinib-induced senescence was associated with elevated levels of p15 and p27 but was not dependent on the expression of p16 or p21. Restoring wild type p53 activity either by transfection or by treatment with APR-246, a molecule which reactivates mutant p53, blocked lapatinib-induced senescence and caused increased cell death. In contrast to lapatinib, SA-β-gal activity was not induced by exposing the cells to trastuzumab as a single agent but co-administration of lapatinib and trastuzumab induced senescence, as did treatment of the cells with the irreversible HER2 TKIs neratinib and afatinib. Neratinib-and afatinib-induced senescence was not reversed by removing the drug whereas lapatinib-induced senescence was reversible. In summary, therapy-induced senescence represents a novel mechanism of action of HER2 targeting agents and may be a potential pathway for the emergence of resistance. © 2018 by the authors.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062394539

Materials and Methods: Women diagnosed with BC of age ≤50 years in 2009-2012 were recruited through the Florida State Cancer Registry to complete a questionnaire. Results: There were 1182 participants of which 61% (174/285) of Hispanic patients, and 65% (580/897) of NHW patients had BC testing. Among untested participants, the most common barriers were lack of testing recommendation (44% Hispanics, 32% NHW; p = 0.02) and cost-related concerns (41% Hispanics, 40% NHW; p = 0.83). Among tested participants, the top facilitators were as follows: (1) ""To benefit my family's future"" (70% Hispanic, 68% NHW), (2) ""My doctor recommended testing"" (60% Hispanic, 54% NHW), and (3) ""Minimal cost to me"" (59% Hispanic, 72% NHW). Only 27% of tested and 15% of untested women were aware of GINA; misuse of test results was reported as a barrier for only 6.5%. Conclusions: Rates of genetic testing recommendation are lower among Hispanics, but both groups reported additional barriers. Most are unaware of GINA, yet misuse is not a highly cited barrier. Findings suggest the need to educate providers on the importance of recommending testing to all who meet criteria; increase awareness of newer options for more affordable testing; and bolster facilitators that may increase testing uptake. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061260927

METHODS: The WISDOM survey queried obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYNs) and primary care physicians (PCPs) with 23 multipart questions assessing behaviors and attitudes towards VVA treatment. RESULTS: Of 2,424 surveys sent, 945 (39%) responded and 644 (27%) were completed. Of the menopausal women seen by OB/GYNs and PCPs, 44% to 55% reported having VVA symptoms. Physicians prescribed VVA treatments primarily because of effectiveness. Only 34% of OB/GYNs and 17% of PCPs felt comfortable prescribing VVA therapies to women with a personal history of breast cancer. In general, the most common VVA treatment recommended by all was prescription therapy (49%; with or without other therapies) in the form of US Food and Drug Administration-approved vaginal estrogen creams. More OB/GYNs (72%) than PCPs (47%) disagreed that VVA was best treated with over the counter than prescription products. Out-of-pocket cost and fear of risks associated with estrogens were believed to be the main barriers for why women choose not to get treated and why they discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: More OB/GYNs than PCPs prescribed VVA treatment, especially vaginal estrogens, for menopausal women, but both groups generally had similar attitudes and behaviors regarding VVA treatment. Physician comfort was low when prescribing to women with a history of breast cancer, despite women's health medical societies supporting vaginal estrogen use in women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who were unresponsive to nonhormonal therapies when offered in consultation with their oncologist.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060386906

However, the activity of pharmacologic targeting of either pathway is modest. Mechanisms of resistance to these monotherapies have not been clarified. Currently, commonly used mouse models are inadequate for studying the HGF-MET axis because mouse HGF does not bind human MET. We established human HGF-MET paired mouse models. In this study, we evaluated the cooperative effects of MET and PIK3CA in an environment with involvement of human HGF in vivo Oncogenic MET/PIK3CA synergistically induced aggressive behavior and resistance to each targeted therapy in an HGF-paracrine environment. Combined targeting of MET and PI3K abrogates resistance. Associated cell signaling changes were explored by functional proteomics. Consistently, combined targeting of MET and PI3K inhibited activation of associated oncogenic pathways. We also evaluated the response of tumor cells to HGF stimulation using breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). HGF stimulation induced significant phosphorylation of MET for all PDX lines detected to varying degrees. However, the levels of phosphorylated MET are not correlated with its expression, suggesting that MET expression level cannot be used as a sole criterion to recruit patients to clinical trials for MET-targeted therapy. Altogether, our data suggest that combined targeting of MET and PI3K could be a potential clinical strategy for breast cancer patients, where phosphorylated MET and PIK3CA mutation status would be biomarkers for selecting patients who are most likely to derive benefit from these cotargeted therapy. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061023665

However, our previous studies and others have observed that structural variants, such as ESR1 fusions, may also play a role. Therefore, we expanded upon these observations by performing a comprehensive and highly sensitive characterization of copy-number (CN) alterations in a large clinical cohort of metastatic specimens. NanoString DNA hybridization was utilized to measure CN gains, amplifications, and deletions of 67 genes in 108 breast cancer metastases, and in 26 cases, the patient-matched primary tumor. For ESR1, a copyshift algorithm was applied to identify CN imbalances at exon-specific resolution and queried large data sets (&gt;15,000 tumors) that had previously undergone next-generation sequencing (NGS). Interestingly, a subset of ER+ tumors showed increased ESR1 CN (11/82, 13%); three had CN amplifications (4%) and eight had gains (10%). Increased ESR1 CN was enriched in metastatic specimens versus primary tumors, and this was orthogonally confirmed in a large NGS data set. ESR1-amplified tumors showed a site-specific enrichment for bone metastases and worse outcomes than nonamplified tumors. No ESR1 CN amplifications and only one gain was identified in ER - tumors. ESR1 copyshift was present in 5 of the 11 ESR1-amplified tumors.

However, these studies remain inconsistent. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the role of leptin in the patients with BC. METHOD: A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases was conducted up to September 1, 2017. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to pool the effect size. A funnel plot and Egger test were used to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Finally, 43 eligible studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Overall, serum leptin levels in BC cases were significantly higher compared with the controls (SMD = 0.61, P <.0001). When subgroup analyses were restricted to ethnicity and menstrual status, higher serum leptin concentration was also detected in patients with BC. Moreover, BC cases with body mass index (BMI) >25 indicated significantly higher serum leptin levels (SMD = 1.48, P = .034). Furthermore, the BC cases with lymph node metastases showed significantly higher serum leptin concentration (SMD = 0.53, P = .015). CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that the serum leptin may profiles as a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and metastasis of BC. In addition, leptin will provide useful information for a therapeutic target to treat BC.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060953970

Salivary gland MEC are most frequently associated with CRTC1–MAML2 translocations. Exceedingly rare MEC of the breast demonstrate a basal-like and often triple (oestrogen and progesterone receptor, HER2)-negative immunophenotype, with a single case previously reported to show MAML2 rearrangement, although the fusion partner was not known. Comprehensive genomic studies of breast MEC are lacking. In this study, we analysed the immunophenotype and molecular landscape of two breast MEC to elucidate the pathogenesis of these rare tumours. Methods and results: Two breast MEC were subjected to capture-based next-generation DNA sequencing of 479 cancer-related genes. The presence of the CRTC1–MAML2 fusion transcript was interrogated by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the immunoprofiles of breast MEC were compared to salivary gland MEC. Both breast MEC harboured CRTC1–MAML2 fusions. In contrast to most triple-negative breast carcinomas of no special type, the mutational burden of MEC was very low, with one case demonstrating only an inactivating SETD2 mutation, and the other harbouring no somatic variants in genes on the panel. No copy number alterations were identified. The immunoprofiles of breast and salivary gland MEC were overlapping, but not identical. Conclusions: The findings highlight MEC as a breast cancer subtype more closely related to its salivary gland counterpart than to basal-like/triple-negative breast cancers of no special type. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85057984159

Objective: To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and activity of alpelisib, an oral, PI3Kα-specific inhibitor, plus fulvestrant in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer (ABC). Design, Setting, and Participants: An open-label, single-arm, phase 1b study of alpelisib plus fulvestrant was conducted at 10 centers in 5 countries. Participants were 87 postmenopausal women with PIK3CA-altered or PIK3CA-wild-type ER+ ABC, whose cancer progressed during or after antiestrogen therapy. The study began enrolling patients October 5, 2010, and the data cutoff was March 22, 2017. Interventions: Escalating doses of alpelisib were administered once daily, starting at 300 mg, plus fixed-dose fulvestrant, 500 mg, in the dose-escalation phase; alpelisib at the recommended phase 2 dose plus fulvestrant in the dose-expansion phase. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was determination of the MTD of once-daily alpelisib plus fulvestrant. Secondary end points included safety and preliminary activity. Results: From October 5, 2010, to March 22, 2017, 87 women (median age: 58 years [range, 37-79 years]; median of 5 prior lines of antineoplastic therapy) received escalating once-daily doses of alpelisib (300 mg, n = 9; 350 mg, n = 8; 400 mg, n = 70) plus fixed-dose fulvestrant (500 mg). During dose escalation, dose-limiting toxic effects were reported in 1 patient (alpelisib, 400 mg): diarrhea (grade 2), vomiting, fatigue, and decreased appetite (all grade 3). The MTD of alpelisib when combined with fulvestrant was 400 mg once daily, and the recommended phase 2 dose was 300 mg once daily. Overall, the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events with alpelisib, 400 mg, once daily (≥10% of patients), regardless of causality, were hyperglycemia (19 [22%]) and maculopapular rash (11 [13%]); 9 patients permanently discontinued therapy owing to adverse events. Median progression-free survival at the MTD was 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.6-9.0 months). Median progression-free survival with alpelisib, 300 to 400 mg, once daily plus fulvestrant was longer in patients with PIK3CA-altered tumors (9.1 months; 95% CI, 6.6-14.6 months) vs wild-type tumors (4.7 months; 95% CI, 1.9-5.6 months). Overall response rate in the PIK3CA-altered group was 29% (95% CI, 17%-43%), with no objective tumor responses in the wild-type group. Conclusions and Relevance: Alpelisib plus fulvestrant has a manageable safety profile in patients with ER+ ABC, and data suggest that this combination may have greater clinical activity in PIK3CA-altered vs wild-type tumors.

Previous research has demonstrated that the atypical protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) is a component of numerous dysregulated pathways in breast cancer, including cellular proliferation, survival, and cell cycle upregulation. The present study investigated the PKC-ζ protein in breast tissue to evaluate its potential as a biomarker for breast cancer invasion, and demonstrated that an overexpression of PKC-ζ protein can be indicative of carcinogenesis. The present study analyzed the expression of PKC-ζ in individuals with no tumor complications and malignant female human breast tissue samples (lobular carcinoma in situ, invasive lobular carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma) with the use of western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and statistical analysis (83 samples). The present study also evaluated the invasive behavior of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells following the knockdown of PKC-ζ with a Transwell invasion assay and an immunofluorescent probe for filamentous actin (F-actin) organization. The data demonstrated that PKC-ζ expression was identified to be higher in invading tissues when compared with non-invading tissues. The results also suggest that PKC-ζ is more abundant in ductal tissues when compared with lobular tissues. In addition, the protein studies also suggest that PKC-ζ is a component for invasive behavior through the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) and Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) pathway, and PKC-ζ is required for the F-actin reorganization in invasive cells. Therefore, PKC-ζ should be considered to be a biomarker in the development of breast cancer as well as an indicator of invading tumor cells. © 2019, Spandidos Publications.

However, guidelines are lacking regarding their optimal sequencing with other available agents. This study examines physician practice patterns and treatment outcomes of palbociclib and subsequent therapies in a real-world setting. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for consecutive patients with MBC who received palbociclib between February 2015 and August 2017 at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate time-to-event curves and estimate median progression-free survival (mPFS). Log-rank test was used to compare differences. Results: A total of 200 patients, with a median age of 59.4 years and a follow-up of 19.5 months, were included. Palbociclib was most frequently combined with letrozole (73.5%), followed by fulvestrant (25%), anastrozole (1%), and tamoxifen (0.5%). Most patients received palbociclib in the endocrine-resistant setting (n542, n550, and n5108 in the first-, second-, and subsequent-line settings, respectively), and the fraction of patients receiving palbociclib as first- or second-line therapy increased in recent months (P5.0428). mPFS was 20.7, 12.8, and 4.0 months with palbociclib administered in the first-, second-, and subsequent-line settings, respectively (P,.0001). Incidences of grade 3/4 neutropenia (41.5%) and dose reductions (29%) were comparable to reports in the literature. Among patients whose disease progressed on palbociclib (n5104), the most frequent next-line treatment was capecitabine (n521), followed by eribulin (n516), nab-paclitaxel (n515), and exemestane 1 everolimus (n512). mPFS with hormone therapy alone or in combination with targeted agents (n532) after first-, second-, and subsequent-line palbociclib was 17.0, 9.3, and 4.2 months, respectively (P5.04). mPFS with chemotherapy (n570) was not reached, 4.7, and 4.1 months after first-, second-, and subsequent-line palbociclib, respectively (P5.56).

We evaluated the added prognostic value of residual disease (RD) TILs to residual cancer burden (RCB) in predicting survival post-NAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We combined four TNBC NAC patient cohorts who did not achieve pCR. RD TILs were investigated for associations with recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) using Cox models with stromal TILs as a continuous variable (per 10% increment). The likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate added prognostic value of RD TILs. RESULTS: A total of 375 RD TNBC samples were evaluable for TILs and RCB. The median age was 50 years, with 62% receiving anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy. The RCB class after NAC was 11%, 50%, and 39% for I, II, and III, respectively. The median RD TIL level was 20% (IQR 10-40). There was a positive correlation between RD TIL levels and CD8+ T-cell density (ρ = 0.41). TIL levels were significantly lower with increasing post-NAC tumor (P = 0.005), nodal stage (P = 0.032), but did not differ by RCB class (P = 0.84). Higher RD TILs were significantly associated with improved RFS (HR: 0.86; 95% CI 0.79-0.92; P < 0.001), and improved OS (HR: 0.87; 95% CI 0.80-0.94; P < 0.001), and remained significant predictors in multivariate analysis (RFS P = 0.032; OS P = 0.038 for OS). RD TILs added significant prognostic value to multivariate models including RCB class (P < 0.001 for RFS; P = 0.021 for OS). The positive prognostic effect of RD TILs significantly differed by RCB class for RFS (PInt=0.003) and OS (PInt=0.008) with a greater magnitude of positive effect observed for RCB class II than class III. CONCLUSIONS: TIL levels in TNBC RD are significantly associated with improved RFS and OS and add further prognostic information to RCB class, particularly in RCB class II. © The Author(s) 2018.

We sought to determine (a) whether a structured exercise training program would attenuate reductions in VO 2 peak and (b) whether exercise cardiac imaging is a more sensitive marker of cardiac injury than the current standard of care resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Methods: Twenty-eight patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing anthracycline chemotherapy were able to choose between exercise training (mean ± SD age 47 ± 9 years, n = 14) or usual care (mean ± SD age 53 ± 9 years, n = 14). Measurements performed before and after anthracycline chemotherapy included cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine VO 2 peak and functional disability (VO 2 peak &lt; 18 ml/min/kg), resting echocardiography (LVEF and global longitudinal strain), cardiac biomarkers (troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide) and exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to determine stroke volume and peak cardiac output. The exercise training group completed 2 × 60 minute supervised exercise sessions per week. Results: Decreases in VO 2 peak during chemotherapy were attenuated with exercise training (15 vs. 4% reduction, P = 0.010) and fewer participants in the exercise training group met the functional disability criteria after anthracycline chemotherapy compared with those in the usual care group (7 vs. 50%, P = 0.01). Compared with the baseline, the peak exercise heart rate was higher and the stroke volume was lower after chemotherapy (P = 0.003 and P = 0.06, respectively). There was a reduction in resting LVEF (from 63 ± 5 to 60 ± 5%, P = 0.002) and an increase in troponin (from 2.9 ± 1.3 to 28.5 ± 22.4 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.0001), but no difference was observed between the usual care and exercise training group. The baseline peak cardiac output was the strongest predictor of functional capacity after anthracycline chemotherapy in a model containing age and resting cardiac function (LVEF and global longitudinal strain). Conclusions: The peak exercise cardiac output can identify patients at risk of chemotherapy-induced functional disability, whereas current clinical standards are unhelpful. Functional disability can be prevented with exercise training. © The European Society of Cardiology 2018.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060151227

Design A cross-sectional study. Setting The United States. Participants The subject of analysis was 11 436 journal articles on cancer funded by the US government published in 2016. These articles were identified via PubMed and characterised as receiving online media attention based on data provided by Altmetric. Results 16.8% (n=1925) of articles published on US government-funded research were covered in the media. Published journal articles addressed all common cancers. Frequency of journal articles differed substantially across the common cancers, with breast cancer (n=1284), lung cancer (n=630) and prostate cancer (n=586) being the subject of the most journal articles. Roughly one-fifth to one-fourth of journal articles within each cancer category received online media attention. Media mentions were disproportionate to actual burden of each cancer type (ie, incidence and mortality), with breast cancer articles receiving the most media mentions. Scientific articles also covered the stages of the cancer continuum to varying degrees. Across the 13 most common cancer types, 4.4% (n=206) of articles focused on prevention and control, 11.7% (n=550) on diagnosis and 10.7% (n=502) on therapy. Conclusions Findings revealed a mismatch between prevalent cancers and cancers highlighted in online media. Further, journal articles on cancer control and prevention received less media attention than other cancer continuum stages. Media mentions were not proportional to actual public cancer burden nor volume of scientific publications in each cancer category.

Efforts to increase HFRT use have had mixed success. We implemented a prospective peer review chart rounds integrating all practice sites and reviewed the use of HFRT in an attempt to identify potential predictors of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Patients treated with whole-breast radiation therapy within our cancer care network from January 2016 to June 2017 were evaluated. Radiation courses with a dose per fraction of greater than 2 Gy were considered HFRT, whereas those with a dose per fraction of less than or equal to 2 Gy were considered as conventionally fractionated radiation therapy. Patient, provider, and tumor characteristics were categorized by use of HFRT and compared between groups using a χ2 test or two-tailed t test. RESULTS:: A total of 349 consecutive patients were identified. All 120 patients treated at the main academic site received HFRT. There was significant variation in use of HFRT among community-based providers (28% to 100%; P < .001). There was increased use of HFRT after implementation of institution-wide prospective peer review (66% v 81% before and after implementation, respectively; P = .001). Age, tumor grade, chemotherapy receipt, surgeon type (academic v community), and treatment after implementation of peer review all correlated with HFRT use. On multivariable analysis, treatment after implementation of peer review ( P < .001) remained a significant predictor of HFRT use, as did age ( P = .005), tumor grade ( P = .013), and surgeon type ( P < .001). CONCLUSION:: Significant variation persists in the use of HFRT among providers. Increased awareness and oversight through prospective peer review may be useful in improving compliance to HFRT. Expanding these efforts to include education of referring surgeons may be helpful.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061618189

In this study, we evaluated the effect of regorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, in inhibiting BCRP-mediated MDR in silico, in vitro and in vivo. We found that regorafenib significantly sensitized MDR colon cancer cells to BCRP substrates by increasing their intracellular accumulation. There are no significant changes in the expression level or the subcellular distribution of BCRP in the cells exposed to regorafenib. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that regorafenib stimulated BCRP ATPase activity. Our induced-fit docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggested the existence of a strong and stable interaction between regorafenib and the transmembrane domain of human crystalized BCRP. In vivo tumor xenograft study revealed that the combination of regorafenib and topotecan exhibited synergistic effects on mitoxantrone-resistant S1-M1-80 xenograft tumors.

Owing to its rarity, high-volume studies of its clinical characteristics and prognosis are lacking. The purpose of this study was to use a large, contemporary cancer database to investigate the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes for patients with PLC. Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for women with cT1-4N1-3M0 breast cancer with either ILC or PLC histology having received definitive surgical therapy. Chi-squared analysis was performed to determine differences between the cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated overall survival (OS) between all patients and between patients when stratifying by age and subtype. Cox proportional hazards modeling determined variables associated with OS. Results: A total of 115,260 patients met the study criteria; of these, 114,859 (99.6%) had ILC, while 401 (0.4%) had PLC. A greater proportion of patients with PLC had T3-4 and node-positive disease, and were more likely to have ER- and HER2+ disease. PLC histology was associated with worse OS on both univariate and multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). PLC was associated with poorer OS in subgroups that were T3-4/N+ (but not T1-2N0) disease and ER+ (but not ER-) cancers, but not by HER2 status. Conclusions: Patients with PLC, who were more likely to have ER- and HER2+ disease, experienced worse OS than patients with ILC, which may be limited to patients with more advanced clinical stage and ER + disease.

Few qualitative studies have analyzed factors motivating this irreversible decision. Using qualitative methods, this study sought to understand women's decision making and the impact of CPM on self-confidence, sense of femininity, sexual intimacy, and peace of mind. Methods: Women who had CPM within the last 10 years were recruited to participate in the study. We conducted a thematic analysis of the data. Results: Forty-five women were interviewed. When making the decision for CPM, most had incomplete knowledge of potential negative outcomes. However, all believed CPM had more benefits than harms and would confer the most peace of mind and the fewest regrets should cancer return. They knew their contralateral breast cancer risk was low but were not persuaded by statistics. They wanted to do everything possible to reduce their risk of another breast cancer, even by a minimal amount, but most reported paying an unexpectedly high price for this small reduction in risk. Nevertheless, 41 of 45 reported that they would make the same decision again. Conclusions: These findings highlight an opportunity for physicians to reframe the conversation to focus on the patient experience of the tradeoffs of CPM rather than statistical odds of future cancers.

Many nano vehicles suffer from low stability and toxicity, and hence the prerequisite of a non-toxic nano vehicle with effective drug delivery is still being delved. The present study investigates the delivery efficiency of curcumin with non-spherical mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNAs). Their mechanism of drug delivery and signalling proteins activated to induce apoptosis was further explored in MCF-7 cells. A non-spherical MSN was synthesised, functionalised with PEI (MSNAP) and analysed its intracellular behaviour. Our result indicates that MSNAP was non-toxic until 20 µg/mL and likely localizes in cytoplasmic vesicles. On contrast, well-known MCM-41P induced autophagosome formation, indicating cellular toxicity. Curcumin was loaded on MSNAP and its effectiveness in inducing cell death was studied in MCF-7 and in MCF-7R cells. Curcumin loading on MSNAP induces better cell death with 30 µM curcumin, better than unbounded curcumin. Western blot analysis suggest, curcumin induce apoptosis through the activation of caspase 9, 6, 12, PARP, CHOP and PTEN. The cell survival protein Akt1 was downregulated by curcumin with and without the nanostructure. Interestingly, cleaved caspase 9 was activated in higher amount in nano-conjugated curcumin compared to the free curcumin. But other ER resident protein like IRE1α, PERK and GRP78 were downregulated indicating curcumin disturbs ER homeostasis. Further, electron microscopic analysis reveled that nanocurcumin induced apoptosis by disrupting mitochondria and nucleus. Our results with doxorubicin resistant MCF-7 cell lines confirm nanodelivery of doxorubicin and curcumin sensitised cells effectively at lesser concentration. Further docking studies of curcumin indicate it interacts with the apoptotic proteins through hydrogen bonding formation and with higher binding energy. Harini et al.

Although effective, the test is invasive and expensive, which has motivated this investigation to determine the potential role of radiomics. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used to predict Oncotype Dx RS using an MRI dataset. Study Type: Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective study from January 2010 to June 2016. Population: In all, 134 patients with ER+/HER2– invasive ductal carcinoma who underwent both breast MRI and Oncotype Dx RS evaluation. Patients were classified into three groups: low risk (group 1, RS &lt;18), intermediate risk (group 2, RS 18–30), and high risk (group 3, RS &gt;30). Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T and 3.0T. Breast MRI, T 1 postcontrast. Assessment: Each breast tumor underwent 3D segmentation. In all, 1649 volumetric slices in 134 tumors (mean 12.3 slices/tumor) were evaluated. A CNN consisted of four convolutional layers and max-pooling layers. Dropout at 50% was applied to the second to last fully connected layer to prevent overfitting. Three-class prediction (group 1 vs. group 2 vs. group 3) and two-class prediction (group 1 vs. group 2/3) models were performed. Statistical Tests: A 5-fold crossvalidation test was performed using 80% training and 20% testing. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated. Results: The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 81% (95% confidence interval [CI] ± 4%) in three-class prediction with specificity 90% (95% CI ± 5%), sensitivity 60% (95% CI ± 6%), and the area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (SD, 0.01).

Initial studies have shown that optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an effective margin-evaluation tool for breast-conserving surgery, but methods for the interpretation of breast OCT images have not been directly studied. In this work, breast pathologies were assessed with a handheld OCT probe. OCT images and corresponding histology were used to develop guidelines for the identification of breast tissue features in OCT images. Methods. Mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery specimens from 26 women were imaged with a handheld OCT probe. During standard pathology specimen dissection, representative 1-cm × 1-cm tissue regions were grossly identified, assessed with OCT, inked for orientation and image-matching purposes, and processed. Histology slides corresponding to the OCT image region were digitally photographed. OCT and histology images from the same region were paired by selecting the best structural matches. Results. In total, 2880 OCT images were acquired from 26 breast specimens (from 26 patients) and 48 matching OCT-histology image pairs were identified. These matched image pairs illustrate tissue types including adipose tissue, dense fibrosis, fibroadipose tissue, blood vessels, regular and hyperplastic ducts and lobules, cysts, cyst, fibroadenoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, calcifications, and biopsy cavities. Differentiation between pathologies was achieved by considering feature boundaries, interior appearance, posterior shadowing or enhancement, and overall morphologic patterns. Conclusions. This is the first work to systematically catalog the critical features of breast OCT images. The results indicate that OCT can be used to identify and distinguish between benign and malignant features in human breast tissue. © The Author(s) 2018.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059300997

Methods: In all, 1,500 US women aged 40 to 74 years who obtained a mammogram within 2 years were surveyed in February 2018. The sampling design yielded 300 respondents in each of five groups categorized based on density reporting law features. Women were asked about their breast density-related knowledge, importance of being notified, and sources of information and if conversations with providers regarding density and supplemental screening occurred. Survey results were compared across groups and between women residing in states with versus without density laws. Results: The majority of respondents in all groups felt that it is important for women to know their breast density type (range, 85%-90%). Women were most likely informed of breast density type by a health care provider (range, 68%-72%), followed by the mammography result letter (range, 48%-68%), and then a radiologist (range, 46%-61%). Women from states with a density law were significantly more likely to have learned of their breast tissue type from a mammogram results letter (60% versus 48%, P =.011) and discuss supplemental screening (67% versus 53%, respectively; P =.008) than women from states without a law.

We performed a meta-analysis to determine whether rs189037 polymorphism influences the occurrence of cancer and examined the relationship between this SNP and the etiology of cancer. Methods: Case-control studies were retrieved from literature databases in accordance with established inclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the association between rs189037 and cancer. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis also were performed. Results: After inclusion criteria were met, fifteen studies - comprising 8660 patients with cancer (cases) and 9259 controls - were included in this meta-analysis. Summary results indicated that an association was found between rs189037 and cancer risk. In the dominant model, the pooled OR using a random effects model was 1.207 (95% CI, 1.090-1.337; P < 0.001). The A allele of rs189037 increased the risk of lung cancer, breast cancer, and oral cancer. Results of subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that the SNP was associated with the risk of cancer among East Asian and Latino, but not Caucasian. Conclusions: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that rs189037 is associated with the occurrence of lung cancer, breast cancer, and oral cancer as the risk factor.

However, it is difficult to determine the effects of specific agents on cognitive impairment in human studies. We describe the development of a human APOE knock-in congenic C57BL/6J mouse model to study cancer-related cognitive impairment. Female APOE3 and APOE4 homozygous mice were either left untreated or treated with the most commonly used breast cancer therapeutic agent, doxorubicin. APOE3 and APOE4 mice had similar behaviors in exploratory and anxiety assays, which were affected transiently by doxorubicin treatment. Spatial learning and memory were measured in a Barnes maze: after 4 days of training, control APOE3 and APOE4 mice were able to escape with similar latencies. In contrast, doxorubicin-treated APOE4 mice had markedly impaired learning compared to doxorubicin-treated APOE3 mice at all time points. Voxel-based morphometry of magnetic resonance images revealed that doxorubicin treatment caused significant changes in the cortex and hippocampus of in both APOE3 and APOE4 mouse brains, but the differences were significantly greater in the APOE4 brains. The results indicate that doxorubicin-exposed APOE4 mice recapitulate key aspects of human cancer-related cognitive impairment. These data support the usefulness of this novel preclinical model for future elucidation of the genetic and molecular interactions of APOE genotype with chemotherapy; this model can also allow extension to prospective studies of older mice to study these interactions in the context of aging. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054492546

Here we demonstrate that in conditions of elevated glucose, there is increased expression of key drug resistance proteins (ABCB1, ABCG2, ERCC1, and XRCC1), all of which are regulated by the Hedgehog pathway. In elevated glucose conditions, we determined that the Hedgehog pathway transcription factors, GLI1 and GLI2, are modified by O-GlcNAcylation. This modification functionally enhanced their transcriptional activity. The activity of GLI was enhanced when O-GlcNAcase was inhibited, while inhibiting O-GlcNAc transferase caused a decrease in GLI activity. The metabolic impact of hyperglycemic conditions impinges on maintaining PKM2 in the less active state that facilitates the availability of glycolytic intermediates for biosynthetic pathways. Interestingly, under elevated glucose conditions, PKM2 directly influenced GLI activity. Specifically, abrogating PKM2 expression caused a significant decline in GLI activity and expression of drug resistance proteins. Cumulatively, our results suggest that elevated glucose conditions upregulate chemoresistance through elevated transcriptional activity of the Hedgehog/GLI pathway. Interfering in O-GlcNAcylation of the GLI transcription factors may be a novel target in controlling cancer progression and drug resistance of breast cancer. © 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056451431

Targeting of KLRG1 neutralization in murine cancer models has not previously been reported. Methods: We studied KLRG1 expression in human blood and tumor samples from available genomic datasets. Anti-KLRG1 neutralizing antibody was studied in the murine 4T1 breast cancer as monotherapy, and in the MC38 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma models as combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibody. Results: In human blood and tumor samples, KLRG1 expression is aligned with cytotoxic T and NK cell differentiation, and upregulated in human tumor samples after a variety of therapies, potentially contributing to adaptive resistance. In in vivo murine models, anti-KLRG1 antibody monotherapy in the 4T1 breast cancer model reduced lung metastases (decreased lung weights p=0.04; decreased nodule count p=0.002), while anti-KLRG1 + anti-PD-1 combination therapy in the MC38 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma models produced synergistic benefit greater than anti-PD-1 alone for tumor volume (MC38 p=0.01; B16F10 p=0.007) and survival (MC38 p=0.02; B16F10 p=0.002). Conclusions: These studies provide the first evidence that inhibition of the KLRG1 pathway enhances immune control of cancer in murine models, and provide target validation for KLRG1 targeting of human cancer.

We sought to identify TE infection risks and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) and infection control protocol impacts on infection in a longitudinal study. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed TE/implant reconstructions in 2004 (no ADM), 2009 (TE and ADM), 2013 (TE, ADM, and infection control protocol), and 2015 (TE, ADM, and infection control protocol). We assessed demographic, disease, and operative factors and analyzed rates of seroma, hematoma, skin necrosis, and infection. Statistical analysis, including simple and multivariable logistic regression, was performed using Stata v13.1. Results: 478 TEs were placed in 324 women, with a 30% overall patient complication rate (23% of breasts). A total of 14% of TEs became infected. Although unadjusted analysis showed no ADM and infection association (p = 0.269), multivariable logistic regression showed a significant association with more infections (OR: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.13–9.313; p = 0.029). The infection control protocol decreased infections by 28% (16% in 2009 vs 11% in 2013); however, this did not achieve statistical significance (unadjusted p = 0.192, adjusted p = 0.156). Seroma (p < 0.001), older age (p = 0.040), larger mastectomy volume (p = 0.001), smoking (p = 0.037), BMI (p < 0.001), vascular disorders (p = 0.007), and hypertension (p < 0.001) significantly increased infections. Conclusions: Identifiable risks exist in TE/implant breast reconstruction. ADM infection risk may mitigate some potential benefits. Anti-infection protocols may reduce infections, and further investigation may reveal the most effective prophylactic strategies.

In breast cancer, HER2 status is associated with increased risk of brain metastases and response to HER2-targeted therapy. The purpose of this project was to compare HER2 status in GI cancer brain metastases versus matched prior sites of disease in order to determine if HER2+ disease is more common intracranially. Materials and Methods: We identified 28 patients with GI cancer who had craniotomy for brain metastases between 1999 and 2017 with intracranial metastatic tissue available at Massachusetts General Hospital. Twenty-four patients also had tissue from a prior site of disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2 were performed on all samples. A tumor was defined as HER2+ if it had 3+ staining by IHC or amplification by FISH. Results: A prior site of disease (including intracranial metastases) was HER2+ for 13% of evaluable patients: 3 of 11 patients with colorectal cancer and no patients with esophageal or pancreatic cancer. The most recent brain metastases were HER2+ for 32% of patients: 2 of 3 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 3 of 10 esophageal adenocarcinomas (ACs), 3 of 14 colorectal ACs, and 1 of 1 pancreatic AC. Only 37.5% of patients with HER2+ brain metastasis had concordant HER2+ prior tissue (κ = 0.38, p =.017). Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with GI cancer with brain metastases, HER2+ status was more common intracranially compared with prior sites of disease. These findings suggest that testing HER2 in patients with GI cancer with brain metastases may lead to additional therapeutic options, regardless of HER2 status in previously examined tissue. Implications for Practice: HER2 amplification is a well-known driver of oncogenesis in breast cancer, with associated increased risk of brain metastases and response to HER2-directed therapy. In nongastric gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, HER2 amplification is not common and consequently is infrequently tested. The current study shows that brain metastases in patients with GI primary malignancies have a relatively high likelihood of being HER2 positive despite HER2 amplification or overexpression being less commonly found in matched tissue from prior sites of disease. This suggests that regardless of prior molecular testing, patients with GI cancer with brain metastases who have tissue available are likely to benefit from HER2 assessment to identify potential novel therapeutic options. © AlphaMed Press 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85056151806

However, the role of microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) expression in brain cancer is largely unknown. To determine whether MAPT expression is related to low-grade glioma (LGG) survival rates, RNASeq data representing samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were assessed. Results revealed that high expression of the MAPT gene is very strongly associated with increased overall and disease-free survival in LGG but not in breast cancer or melanoma. No such association was apparent for either amyloid precursor protein or α-synuclein gene expression. The expression levels of particular apoptosis- and pro-proliferative-effector genes were consistent with the Tau-associated increased survival rates. It has been well established that the Tau protein plays a neurodegenerative role, and in this study we identified, for the first time, a potential cell apoptosis function that Tau may play in cancers of the central nervous system. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Our in-house method requires application of a bolus during the optimization process with a target outside of the body, then removing the bolus during the final calculation in order to incorporate skin flash in VMAT plans. To quantify the dosimetric trade-offs between traditional 3D field-in-field tangents and VMAT with integrated skin flash for these patients, we compared nine consecutive patients who recently received radiation to their entire left breast but not their regional lymphatics. Tangent plans used non-divergent tangents of mixed energies and VMAT plans utilized four 6 MV arcs of roughly 260°. Mean dose to the heart, contralateral lung, and contralateral breast and their volume receiving 5%, 10%, and 20% of the prescription dose were higher in all nine VMAT plans than in the static tangential beam plans. For all critical structures, the mean VMAT DVH was higher in the low-dose region and crossed the 3D field-in-field DVH between 23.13% and 34.18% of the prescription dose (984.75-1454.70 cGy). However, the volume of the contralateral breast and heart receiving the prescription dose was slightly lower in the VMAT plans, but not statistically significant. VMAT provided superior homogeneity, with a mean homogeneity index of 9.41 ± 1.64 compared to 11.05 ± 1.82 for 3D tangents. Results indicate that VMAT spares the heart, contralateral lung, and contralateral breast from prescription dose at the cost of increasing their mean and low-dose volume and delivers a more homogenous dose distribution to the breast. For these reasons, VMAT is selectively applied at the request of the physician for left breast radiation without respiratory gating to spare the heart from prescription dose in cases of poor anatomical geometry. © 2019 The Authors.

In contrast, adolescent body size has been consistently, negatively associated with both MD and breast cancer risk. It is unclear when the direction of these associations changes and whether weight gain in infancy is associated with MD. We evaluated the associations of birth weight and postnatal weight (measured at 4 months, 1 year, and 4 years) by absolute and velocity measures (relative within-cohort percentile changes) with adult mammographic density, assessed using a computer-assisted thresholding program (Cumulus), using linear regression models with generalized estimating equations to account for correlation between siblings in the Early Determinants of Mammographic Density study (1959-2008; n = 700 women with 116 sibling sets; mean age = 44.1 years). Birth weight was positively associated with dense area (per 1-kg increase, β = 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 6.66). Weight gains from 0 months to 4 months and 1 year to 4 years were negatively associated with dense area (for 10-unit increase in weight percentile, β = '0.65, 95% CI: '1.23, '0.07, and β = '1.07, 95% CI: '1.98, '0.16, respectively). Findings were similar in the sibling subset.

However, little is known about the dynamic cross talk between BRCA1 and autophagy in the regulation of drug sensitivity. Here, we investigated the drug resistance-associated regulation of BRCA1 in epithelial ovarian cancer stem cells (EOCSCs). The results indicated that BRCA1 could regulate drug resistance in EOCSCs. Autophagy played a significant role in the stemness maintenance and was a key mechanism underlying the survival against chemotherapy in EOCSCs. Further investigation found that BRCA1 could regulate drug resistance of EOCSCs through autophagy. Meanwhile, changes in the level of autophagy provided feedback regarding the expression of BRCA1. Inhibition of autophagy activity could effectively reduce the resistance of EOCSCs caused by BRCA1. In addition, BRCA1 was able to regulate cellular apoptosis and cell cycle progression under the action of cisplatin through autophagy, indirectly affecting the drug sensitivity of EOCSCs. The present results highlight a novel relationship between BRCA1 and autophagy, which may provide insight into the etiology of BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer, and improve our understanding of resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer. © 2019 The Authors.

Methods: Consecutive diagnostic examinations from August 2008 to February 2011 (DM group) and from January 2013 to July 2015 (DM/DBT group) were reviewed. Core biopsy and surgical pathology results within 365 days after the mammogram were collected. Performance metrics, including cancer detection rate (CDR), abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), positive predictive value (PPV) 2, PPV3, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to compare performance metrics in the DM and DM/DBT groups while adjusting for clinical covariates. Results: A total of 22,883 mammograms were performed before DBT integration (DM group), and 22,824 mammograms were performed after complete DBT integration (DM/DBT group). After adjusting for multiple variables, the CDR was similar in both groups (38.2 per 1,000 examinations in the DM/DBT group versus 31.3 per 1,000 examinations in the DM group, p = 0.14); however, a higher proportion of cancers were invasive rather than in situ in the DM/DBT group [83.7% (731/873) versus 72.3% (518/716), p < 0.01]. The AIR was lower in the DM/DBT group (p < 0.01), and PPV2, PPV3, and specificity were higher in the DM/DBT group (all p = 0.01 or p < 0.01). Conclusions: Complete integration of DBT into the diagnostic setting is associated with improved diagnostic performance. Increased utilization of DBT may thus result in better patient outcomes and lead to a shift in the benchmarks that have been established for DM. Key Points: • Integration of tomosynthesis into the diagnostic setting is associated with improved performance. • A higher proportion of cancers are invasive rather than in situ with digital breast tomosynthesis. • Increased utilization of tomosynthesis may lead to a shift in established benchmarks. © 2018, European Society of Radiology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85049579105

PARP inhibitors trap PARP onto damaged chromatin when combined with temozolomide and methyl methanesulfonate, but the clinical relevance of these findings remains unknown. PARP trapping has thus far been undetectable in cancer cells treated with PARP inhibitors alone. Here, we evaluate the contribution of PARP trapping to the tolerability and efficacy of PARP inhibitors in the monotherapy setting. We developed a novel implementation of the proximity ligation assay to detect chromatin-trapped PARP1 at single-cell resolution with higher sensitivity and throughput than previously reported methods. We further demonstrate that the PARP inhibitor-induced trapping appears to drive single-agent cytotoxicity in healthy human bone marrow, indicating that the toxicity of trapped PARP complexes is not restricted to cancer cells with homologous recombination deficiency. Finally, we show that PARP inhibitors with dramatically different trapping potencies exhibit comparable tumor growth inhibition at MTDs in a xenograft model of BRCA1-mutant triple-negative breast cancer. These results are consistent with emerging clinical data and suggest that the inverse relationship between trapping potency and tolerability may limit the potential therapeutic advantage of potent trapping activity. Implications: PARP trapping contributes to single-agent cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors in both cancer cells and healthy bone marrow, and the therapeutic advantage of potent trapping activity appears to be limited. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059341310

The opportunity to clinically practice CBE depends on patient availability and willingness to be examined by students, especially in culturally sensitive environments. We propose the use of a hybrid simulation model consisting of a standardized patient (SP) wearing a silicone breast simulator jacket and hypothesize that this, compared to traditional teaching methods, would result in improved learning. Consenting third-year medical students (N = 82) at a university-affiliated tertiary care center were cluster-randomized into two groups: hybrid simulation (breast jacket + SP) and control (tabletop breast model). Students received the standard lecture by instructors blinded to the randomization, followed by randomization group-based learning and practice sessions. Two weeks later, participants were assessed in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), which included three stations with SPs blinded to the intervention. The SPs graded the students on CBE completeness, and students completed a self-assessment of their performance and confidence during the examination. CBE completeness scores did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.889). Hybrid simulation improved lesion identification grades (p < 0.001) without increasing false positives. Hybrid simulation relieved the fear of missing a lesion on CBE (p = 0.043) and increased satisfaction with the teaching method among students (p = 0.002). As a novel educational tool, hybrid simulation improves the sensitivity of CBE performed by medical students without affecting its specificity.

However, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms of resistance to PARP1 inhibitors. Expression of HMGA2 in cancer is associated with poor prognosis for patients. Here, we investigated the novel relationship between HMGA2 and PARP1 in DNA damage-induced PARP1 activity. We used human triple-negative breast cancer and fibrosarcoma cell lines to demonstrate that HMGA2 colocalizes and interacts with PARP1. High cellular HMGA2 levels correlated with increased DNA damage-induced PARP1 activity, which was dependent on functional DNA-binding AT-hook domains of HMGA2. HMGA2 inhibited PARP1 trapping to DNA and counteracted the cytotoxic effect of PARP inhibitors. Consequently, HMGA2 decreased caspase 3/7 induction and increased cell survival upon treatment with the alkylating methyl methanesulfonate alone or in combination with the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 (olaparib). HMGA2 increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and spare respiratory capacity and increased NAMPT levels, suggesting metabolic support for enhanced PARP1 activity upon DNA damage. Our data showed that expression of HMGA2 in cancer cells reduces sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and suggests that targeting HMGA2 in combination with PARP inhibition may be a promising new therapeutic approach. © 2018 The Authors.

This study examines the impact patient travel burden has on administration of prophylactic G-CSFs and the subsequent impact on FN incidence. Methods: Medicare claims data were used to identify a cohort of beneficiaries age 65+ with non-myeloid cancers at high risk for FN between January 2012 and December 2014. Driving distance and time were calculated from patient residence ZIP code to the location of G-CSF and/or chemotherapy administration. Regression models were used to estimate the odds of G-CSF prophylaxis relative to patient driving distance and time, and odds of FN incidence relative to timing of G-CSF administration (optimal [days 2–4 after chemotherapy], sub-optimal [same day], or none). Results: The 52,389 study patients had a mean age of 73.5 years, and were 82% female and 89% white race; 49% had female breast cancer, 12% lung cancer, 15% ovarian cancer, and 24% non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Of these high FN risk patients, 69% had at least one prophylactic G-CSF administration within at least one chemotherapy cycle. The percentage of patients receiving prophylactic G-CSFs in the first cycle was 56%. Median travel time was slightly longer for patients who did not receive G-CSFs and patients receiving short-acting vs long-acting G-CSFs. The odds of receiving no G-CSFs were 26–52% higher (depending on cancer type) for patients with a >80-min one-way travel time, compared to patients traveling <20-min. Concurrently, the odds of FN (using a “narrow” definition) were 18–93% higher for patients who did not receive G-CSFs in the first cycle of chemotherapy. Conclusions: Travel burden, linked to clinic visits for G-CSF administration following myelosuppressive chemotherapy, is associated with sub-optimal use of G-CSF prophylaxis, which may result in a higher incidence of FN. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Final",,2-s2.0-85046779269

BPA has also been associated mainly with not only hormone sensitive cancers such as breast, prostate, endometrial, ovarian, testicular and thyroid cancers but also non-hormonal sensitive cancers such as cervical and lung cancers, osteosarcoma and meningioma. Recent research has investigated the sources of contamination which are responsible for higher BPA concentrations in the oral cavity and oropharyngeal space, representing the first site of BPA exposure after ingestion. Besides growing awareness and case registration, the incidence and prevalence of oral (OC) and oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) have increased during the last decades correlating with the increased production of BPA worldwide. So far, no study in the medical literature has explored the association of BPA with OC and OPC. BPA may be linked to the etiopathogenesis of OC and OPC through a multitude of mechanisms encompassing and interconnecting genetic, epigenetic, inflammatory, immune, metabolic, hormonal and oxidative stress alterations as well as modulation of oral microbiome. Hence, it is not possible to rule out a potential role of BPA exposure in oral and oropharyngeal tissue carcinogenesis, especially knowing its potential to participate in other non-hormonal sensitive malignancies and to deregulate signaling pathways implicated in OC and OPC. This perspective aims at outlining evidence and proposing for the first time a potential link between BPA with OC and OPC, the most frequent subtypes of head and neck malignancies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058525116

One such alternative payment model is episode-based payment, such as the Oncology Care Model (OCM) being piloted by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation. OBJECTIVE: To adapt the OCM methodology to a commercially insured population to understand the challenges and potential implications of implementing an episode-based payment model in a commercial health plan. METHODS: Administrative claims databases from 3 regional commercial health plans were used to identify continually eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) with breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Episode triggers were identified using the OCM methodology. In calculating the episode-based payments, adjustments to the OCM methodology were necessary to adapt the methodology to a commercial population, since not all Medicare data elements used in the OCM algorithm are available in commercial claims data. RESULTS: The adapted OCM-like model was applied to data from 39,967 patients with 1 of 4 cancer types. Approximately 13% of patients had at least 1 episode per year and the average number of episodes per patient per year for patients with at least 1 episode ranged from 1.42 for patients with melanoma to 1.94 for patients with CML. The percentage of total annual costs included in episodes was 49%, 60%, 34%, and 52% for breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and CML, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As health care financing shifts to alternative payment models, insurers may look to adopt episode-based payments for oncology, similar to the OCM. This study shows that implementing an OCM-like model in a commercial health plan is feasible but will require adjustments to the OCM algorithm to make it implementable and applicable to populations beyond Medicare.

There was no statistically significant difference in positive predictive values (PPVs) including PPV1 (screening recall), PPV2 (biopsy recommendation), or PPV 3 (biopsy performed) with batch interpretation (10.1%, 42.1%, and 40.0%, respectively) and immediate interpretation (13.6%, 39.2%, and 39.7%, respectively). After adjusting for age, breast density, high-risk status, and comparison mammogram, there was no difference in the odds of being recalled or cancer detection between the two groups. Conclusions: There is no statistically significant difference in interpretation performance metrics for screening tomosynthesis mammograms interpreted immediately compared to those interpreted in a delayed fashion. © 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85046663382

Our aim was to evaluate knowledge of and perception about the significance of baseline mammograms in those women undergoing screening mammography. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective survey study was conducted in women without a history of breast cancer presenting for their screening mammogram. Respondents were surveyed anonymously between March and April 2017. The questionnaire was developed by primary care providers and radiologists and pretested for readability and clarity. Results: In all, 401 women (87% white, 93% educated beyond high school) completed surveys in which 77% of women reported having yearly mammograms, 31% reported having a history of an abnormal mammogram, and 45% had not heard the term baseline mammogram. Of those who had heard the term, the most commonly reported source was their primary care provider (31%). Although 74% chose the correct definition of a baseline mammogram, 67% did not think that a baseline mammogram was important for decreasing associated cost, time, and discomfort due to the number of mammograms incorrectly read as abnormal. Conclusion: In a group of educated women who routinely get mammograms, almost one-half had not heard the term baseline mammogram. Furthermore, most women did not think baseline mammography was important for decreasing associated cost, time, and discomfort due to mammograms incorrectly read as abnormal. This study suggests that efforts to improve women's understanding of baseline mammograms and their importance are warranted, with greatest opportunity for health care providers and radiologists. © 2018 American College of Radiology","Final",,2-s2.0-85053106085

Diagnosis of incident cancer may impede management of CAD, thereby increasing the risk of CAD-related complications and associated healthcare expenditures. This study examined the relationship between incident cancer and CAD-related expenditures among elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Patients and Methods: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using the SEER-Medicare linked registries and a 5% noncancer random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with preexisting CAD and with incident breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer (N512,095) or no cancer (N534,237) were included. CAD-related healthcare expenditures comprised Medicare payments for inpatient, home healthcare, and outpatient services. Expenditures were measured every 120 days during the 1-year preindex and 1-year postindex periods. Adjusted relationship between incident cancer and expenditures was analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models. Results: Overall, CAD-related mean healthcare expenditures in the preindex period accounted for approximately 32.6% to 39.5% of total expenditures among women and 41.5% to 46.8% among men. All incident cancer groups had significantly higher CAD-related expenditures compared with noncancer groups (P,.0001). Men and women with colorectal cancer (CRC) had 166% and 153% higher expenditures, respectively, compared with their noncancer counterparts. Furthermore, men and women with CRC had 57% and 55% higher expenditures compared with those with prostate or breast cancer, respectively. Conclusions: CAD-related expenditures were higher for elderly Medicare beneficiaries with incident cancer, specifically for those with CRC. This warrants the need for effective programs and policies to reduce CAD-related expenditures. Close monitoring of patients with a cancer diagnosis and preexisting CAD may prevent CAD-related events and expenditures. © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061981464

Unlike cytotoxic chemotherapy, drugs such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab are associated with immune-related adverse effects. We recently observed a patient with lung cancer who developed a fulminant warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Objectives: Investigate the frequency and prognosis of AIHA secondary to CPI in a public database and review the literature. Results: A total of 68 cases were identified in the database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 43 were associated with nivolumab, 13 with pembrolizumab, seven with ipilimumab, and five with atezolizumab. All episodes of AIHA were listed as serious. If the total number of adverse events cases reported to the FDA is taken as a reference, AIHA is rare, but occurred more frequently with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents (0.15%-0.25%) than with CTLA-4 inhibitors (0.06%). In addition to our case, the literature review identified 11 similar cases. Most cases of AIHA responded to steroids, but two of 12 were fatal.

Women are the fastest growing patient population using VA healthcare services. Quantifying the types of cancers diagnosed among women in the VA is a critical step toward identifying needed healthcare resources for women Veterans with cancer. Materials and Methods: We obtained data from the VA Central Cancer Registry for cancers newly diagnosed in calendar year 2010. Our analysis was limited to women diagnosed with invasive cancers (e.g., stages I-IV) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010, in the VA healthcare system. We evaluated frequency distributions of incident cancer diagnoses by primary anatomical site, race, and geographic region. For commonly occurring cancers, we reported distribution by stage. Results: We identified 1,330 women diagnosed with invasive cancer in the VA healthcare system in 2010. The most commonly diagnosed cancer among women Veterans was breast (30%), followed by cancers of the respiratory (16%), gastrointestinal (12%), and gynecological systems (12%). The most commonly diagnosed cancers were similar for white and minority women, except white women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with respiratory cancers (p < 0.01) and minority women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Understanding cancer incidence among women Veterans is important for healthcare resource planning. While cancer incidence among women using the VA healthcare system is similar to U.S civilian women, the geographic dispersion and small incidence relative to male cancers raise challenges for high quality, well-coordinated cancer care within the VA. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061572789

However, transient expression of PDL1 and difficulty in tumor stroma penetration has limited the utility of anti-PDL1 therapy. To overcome these limitations, we report a new conjugate between the clinically approved PDL1 antibody (PDL1 AB) and drug Doxorubicin (Dox), named PDL1-Dox. We conjugated PDL1-Dox through a hydrazone linker containing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, which allows it to dissociate in a tumor environment and improves solubility. The purpose of using Dox is to disrupt the tumor extracellular environment so that PDL-1 antibody can penetrate the tumor core. PDL1-Dox demonstrates significant cell killing, disruption of tumor spheroid and induction of apoptosis in a breast cancer cell line. Significant release of IFN-γ suggests PDL1-Dox can upmodulate T cell activation.

However, information on frequency and incidence of PAC is scarce in the United States. Methods: We identified pregnancies among women aged 10-54 years during 2001-2013 from five U.S. health plans participating in the Cancer Research Network (CRN) and the Medication Exposure in Pregnancy Risk Evaluation Program (MEPREP). We extracted information from the health plans' administrative claims and electronic health record databases, tumor registries, and infants' birth certificate files to estimate the frequency and incidence of PAC, defined as cancer diagnosed during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. Results: We identified 846 PAC events among 775,709 pregnancies from 2001 to 2013. The overall incidence estimate was 109.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 101.8-116.7) per 100,000 pregnancies. There was an increase in the incidence between 2002 and 2012 (the period during which complete data were available), from 75.0 (95% CI = 54.9-100.0) per 100,000 pregnancies in 2002 to 138.5 (95% CI = 109.1-173.3) per 100,000 pregnancies in 2012. The most common invasive cancers diagnosed were breast (n = 208, 24.6%), thyroid (n = 168, 19.9%), melanoma (n = 93, 11.0%), hematologic (n = 87, 10.3%), and cervix/uterus (n = 74, 8.7%). Conclusions: Our study provides contemporary incidence estimates of PAC from a population-based cohort of U.S. women.

Myoepithelial precursor cells are lost during progression from in situ to invasive carcinoma. To define the functional role of Thy1-positive cells within the myoepithelial population, we tracked Thy1 expression in human breast cancer samples, isolated THY1-positive myoepithelial progenitor cells (CD44+/CD24low/CD90+), and established long-term cultures (parental cells). Parental cells were used to generate a xenograft model to examine Thy1 expression during tumor formation. Post-transplantation cell cultures lost THY1 expression through methylation at the THY1 locus and this is associated with an increase in EGFR and NOTCH1 transcript levels. Thy1-low cells are sensitive to the EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor lapatinib. High THY1 expression is associated with poorer relapse-free survival in patients with breast cancer. THY1 methylation may track the shift of bipotent progenitors into differentiated cells. Thy1 is a good candidate biomarker in basal-like breast cancer. Implications: Our findings provide evidence that THY1 expression is lost in xenografts due to promoter methylation. Thy1-low cells with increased EGFR and Notch1 expression are responsive to target therapy. Because DNA methylation is often altered in early cancer development, candidate methylation markers may be exploited as biomarkers for basal-like breast cancer. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060922783

We sought to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of integrating pharmacists into the care of older adults with cancer to enhance medication management and vaccination administration. Methods: We randomly assigned patients aged ≥65 years with breast, gastrointestinal, or lung cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy to the pharmacy intervention or usual care. Patients assigned to the intervention met with a pharmacist once during their second or third chemotherapy infusion. We obtained information about patients' medications and vaccinations via patient report and from the electronic health record (EHR) at baseline and week 4. We determined the number of discrepant (difference between patient report and EHR) and potentially inappropriate (Beers Criteria assessed by nonintervention pharmacists blinded to group assignment) medications. We defined the intervention as feasible if >75% of patients enrolled in the study and received the pharmacist visit. Results: From January 17, 2017, to October 27, 2017, we enrolled and randomized 60 patients (80.1% of patients approached). Among those assigned to the intervention, 96.6% received the pharmacist visit. At week 4, intervention patients had higher rates of acquiring vaccinations for pneumonia (27.6% vs. 0.0%, p =.002) and influenza (27.6% vs. 0.0%, p =.002) compared with usual care. Intervention patients had fewer discrepant (5.82 vs. 8.07, p =.094) and potentially inappropriate (3.46 vs. 4.80, p =.069) medications at week 4, although differences were not significant. Conclusion: Integrating pharmacists into the care of older adults with cancer is feasible with encouraging preliminary efficacy for enhancing medication management and improving vaccination rates. Implications for Practice: Results of this study showed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an intervention integrating pharmacists into the care of older adults with cancer. Notably, patients assigned to the intervention had fewer discrepant medications and were more likely to acquire vaccinations for pneumonia and influenza. Importantly, this work represents the first randomized controlled trial involving the integration of pharmacists into the outpatient oncologic care of older adults with cancer. In the future, a larger randomized trial is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of this care model to enhance medication management and improve vaccination outcomes for older patients with cancer. © AlphaMed Press 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85055291339

High expression of SEMA4D was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival/progression-free survival/recurrence-free survival (DFS/PFS/RFS) in tumors (respectively, HRos = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.68-2.50, P < .001; HRdfs/pfs/rfs = 1.59, 95%CI = 1.27-1.98, P < .001). However, the relationship between SEMA4D expression and prognosis of breast cancer patients was failed to find (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.32-1.82, P = .539). Plexin-B1 level showed a significant positive correlation both with OS and DFS of Caucasian breast cancer patients (respectively, HRos = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.39-0.79, P = .001; HRdfs = 0.68, 95%CI = 0.51-0.90, P = .008) CONCLUSIONS:: SEMA4D could be a prospective biomarker for prognostic prediction of various malignancies except breast cancer. For Caucasian breast cancer patients, SEMA4D's high affinity receptor Plexin-B1 showed a significant positive correlation with survival.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061614199

The purpose of this article is to compare commonly used breast cancer risk assessment models, describe the machine learning approach and big data in risk prediction, and summarize the potential benefits and harms of restrictive risk-based screening. CONCLUSION. The commonly used risk assessment models for breast cancer can be complex and cumbersome to use. Each model incorporates different sets of risk factors, which are weighted differently and can produce different results for the same patient. No model is appropriate for all subgroups of the general population and only one model incorporates mammographic breast density. Future development of risk prediction tools that are generalizable and simpler to use are needed in guiding clinical decisions. © 2019 American Roentgen Ray Society.

Methods Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results Program data were analyzed for patients diagnosed as having FPC from 2000 to 2015 (n = 4,008,092). Standardized incidence ratios, excess risk, and average time to diagnosis of a second primary pancreatic NET were reported by FPC site, stratified by sex and receipt of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Results Risk of pancreatic NET was significantly higher after FPC at any site, any solid tumor (standardized incidence ratios, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.5), pancreas, thymus, small intestine, liver, stomach, kidney, lung, and female breast. Excess incidence of pancreatic NET was highest among those with FPC (especially NET) of the pancreas, bladder, thymus, and female breast; those who received radiotherapy/chemotherapy for bladder, melanoma, and stomach cancers; and those who received chemotherapy for uterine, cervical, prostate, and other genital cancers. Time to diagnosis was shortest after pancreatic, liver, lung, and stomach cancer. Conclusions Cancer survivors have increased risk and excess incidence of primary pancreatic NET compared with the population, particularly for certain primary sites. High-risk patients should receive regular follow-up screenings, counseling to reduce carcinogen exposure, and lifestyle interventions. © Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Molecular comparisons between primary tumors and metastases can provide insights into the pathways and processes involved. Here, we systematically analyzed and cataloged molecular correlates of metastasis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets across 11 different cancer types, these data involving 4,473 primary tumor samples and 395 tumor metastasis samples (including 369 from melanoma). For each cancer type, widespread differences in gene transcription between primary and metastasis samples were observed. For several cancer types, metastasis-associated genes from TCGA comparisons were found to overlap extensively with external results from independent profiling datasets of metastatic tumors. Although some differential expression patterns associated with metastasis were found to be shared across multiple cancer types, by and large each cancer type showed a metastasis signature that was distinctive from those of the other cancer types. Functional categories of genes enriched in multiple cancer type-specific metastatic overexpression signatures included cellular response to stress, DNA repair, oxidation- reduction process, protein deubiquitination, and receptor activity. The TCGA-derived prostate cancer metastasis signature in particular could define a subset of aggressive primary prostate cancer. Transglutaminase 2 protein and mRNA were both elevated in metastases from breast and melanoma cancers. Alterations in miRNAs and inDNAmethylation were also identified. Implications: Our findings suggest that there are different molecular pathways to metastasis involved in different cancers.

In vitro results revealed that mPEG@HGNPs could achieve a synergistic antitumor effect when irradiated by combined X-ray radiation and 808 nm near infrared laser light. Furthermore, mPEG@HGNPs exhibited a favorable tumor targeting effect and good CT contrast enhancement in both xenografted and orthotopic breast tumor models, due to the stealth effect of PEG which increased the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

Objective: To identify patients with uncommon, yet devastating, illnesses using a combination of administrative data and natural language processing (NLP). Design/Setting: Retrospective cohort study using the electronic medical records of a healthcare network totaling over 2500 hospital beds. We sought to identify patient populations with two unique disease processes associated with a poor prognosis: pneumoperitoneum and leptomeningeal metastases from breast cancer. Measurements: Patients with pneumoperitoneum or leptomeningeal metastasis from breast cancer were identified through administrative codes and NLP. Results: Administrative codes alone resulted in identification of 6438 patients with possible pneumoperitoneum and 557 patients with possible leptomeningeal metastasis. Adding NLP to this analysis reduced the number of patients to 869 with pneumoperitoneum and 187 with leptomeningeal metastasis secondary to breast cancer. Administrative codes alone yielded a 13% positive predictive value (PPV) for pneumoperitoneum and 25% PPV for leptomeningeal metastasis. The combination of administrative codes and NLP achieved a PPV of 100%. The entire process was completed within hours. Conclusions: Adding NLP to the use of administrative codes allows for rapid identification of seriously ill patients with otherwise difficult to detect disease processes and eliminates costly, tedious, and time-intensive manual chart review. This method enables studies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, including palliative interventions, for unique populations of seriously ill patients who cannot be identified by administrative codes alone. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061039324

Data Sources: Prospectively collected from San Francisco Mammography Registry (SFMR) 2005-2011, California Cancer Registry 2005-2012, SFMR facility survey 2012. Study Design: We examined time to biopsy for 17 750 abnormal mammogram results (BI-RADS 4/5), categorizing eight facilities as short or long follow-up based on proportion of mammograms with biopsy at 30 days. We examined facility population vulnerability (race/ethnicity, language, education), and system processes. Among women with a cancer diagnosis, we modeled odds of advanced-stage (≥IIb) cancer diagnosis by facility follow-up group. Data Extraction Methods: Merged SFMR, Cancer Registry and facility survey data. Principal Findings: Facilities (N = 4) with short follow-up completed biopsies by 30 days for 82% of mammograms compared with 62% for facilities with long follow-up (N = 4) (P < 0.0001). All facilities serving high proportions of vulnerable women were long follow-up facilities. The long follow-up facilities had fewer radiologists, longer biopsy appointment wait times, and less communication directly with women. Having the index abnormal mammogram at a long follow-up facility was associated with higher adjusted odds of advanced-stage cancer (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.10-1.91). Conclusions: Providing mammography facilities serving vulnerable women with appropriate resources may decrease disparities in abnormal mammogram follow-up and cancer diagnosis stage. © 2018 The Authors.

There is no currently available standard therapy option, although a few promising treatment strategies, including enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibition, are under active investigation. This report describes a 30-year-old woman with INI-1-deficient carcinoma who progressed on combination chemotherapy and an EZH2 inhibitor. Next-generation-sequencing-based targeted cancer-related gene assay confirmed SMARCB1 loss and revealed other mutations in breast cancer 1 gene and checkpoint kinase 2 gene, which may have impacted her clinical course. After discussion at the molecular tumor board, she was offered alisertib, an aurora A kinase inhibitor, on a single-patient expanded-use program and achieved prolonged disease stabilization. Aurora A kinase inhibition may have an important role in the management of patients with INI-1-deficient tumors, warranting further evaluation in clinical studies. Key Points: Loss of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1 gene (SMARCB1), which encodes integrase interactor 1 (INI-1), is associated with various mesenchymal malignancies, but a few carcinomas with rhabdoid features have been recently described as a distinct entity. INI-1-deficient carcinoma can be very aggressive, and there is no known treatment option available. There are encouraging preliminary data with an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitor, tazematostat, in INI-1-deficient malignancies, including INI-1-deficient carcinomas. Loss of INI-1 can activate aurora A kinase (AurkA), and inhibition of AurkA by alisertib could be a viable option and warrants further investigation in this cancer.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, crossover flaxseed intervention study in 252 healthy, postmenopausal women [137 European ancestry (EA) and 115 African ancestry (AA)] from western New York. Participants were randomly assigned to maintain usual diet or consume 10 g/day ground flaxseed for 6 weeks. After a 2-month washout period, participants crossed over to the other diet condition for an additional 6 weeks. Urinary ENL excretion was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 70 polymorphisms in 29 genes related to steroid hormone and xenobiotic metabolism were genotyped. Mixed additive genetic models were constructed to examine association of genetic variation with urinary ENL excretion at baseline and after the flaxseed intervention. Results: SNPs in several genes were nominally (P < 0.05) associated with ENL excretion at baseline and/or after intervention: ESR1, CYP1B1, COMT, CYP3A5, ARPC1A, BCL2L11, SHBG, SLCO1B1, and ZKSCAN5. A greater number of SNPs were associated among AA women than among EA women, and no SNPs were associated in both races. No SNP-ENL associations were statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Variation in several genes related to steroid hormone metabolism was associated with lignan excretion at baseline and/or after flaxseed intervention among postmenopausal women.

Cell signaling kinases are important for regulating lipid synthesis and energy storage. How upstream kinases regulate lipid content, versus direct targeting of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, is currently unexplored. We evaluated intracellular lipid concentrations in prostate and breast tumor spheroids, treated with drugs directly inhibiting metabolic enzymes fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), diacylglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK), or cell signaling kinase enzymes PI3K, AKT, and mTOR with lipidomic analysis. We assessed whether baseline lipid profiles corresponded to inhibitors' effectiveness in modulating lipid profiles in three-dimensional (3D) growth and their relationship to therapeutic activity. Inhibitors against PI3K, AKT, and mTOR significantly inhibited MDA-MB-468 and PC3 cell growth in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D spheroid growth, while moderately altering lipid content. Conversely, metabolism inhibitors against FASN and DGAT altered lipid content most effectively, while only moderately inhibiting growth compared with kinase inhibitors. The FASN and ACC inhibitors' effectiveness in MDA-MB-468, versus PC3, suggested the former depended more on synthesis, whereas the latter may salvage lipids. Although baseline lipid profiles did not predict growth effects, lipid changes on therapy matched the growth effects of FASN and DGAT inhibitors. Several phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, were also upregulated following treatment, possibly via the Kennedy pathway. As this promotes tumor growth, combination studies should include drugs targeting it. Two-dimensional drug screening may miss important metabolism inhibitors or underestimate their potency. Clinical studies should consider serial measurements of tumor lipids to prove target modulation. Pretherapy tumor classification by de novo lipid synthesis versus uptake may help demonstrate efficacy. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061053516

In addition to mutation of TP53, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene can have a profound impact on p53 function, and can affect cancer risk as well as other p53 functions. Wild type (WT) p53 contains a proline at amino acid 47, but approximately 1% of African-Americans express a p53 allele with a serine at amino acid 47 (Pro47Ser, hereafter S47). In a mouse model for this variant, mice expressing S47 are predisposed to spontaneous cancers. The S47 variant also is associated with increased pre-menopausal breast cancer risk in African American women. We recently reported that S47 tumor cells are resistant to the majority of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, but show increased sensitivity to a subset of anticancer agents, compared to tumors with WT p53. In this work, we report on another potentially promising therapeutic vulnerability of S47 tumors. We find that S47 tumors show decreased mitochondrial metabolism, along with increased dependency on glycolysis. S47 tumor cells also show increased sensitivity to the glycolytic poison 2-deoxy-glucose. We propose that the altered metabolism in S47 tumor cells may be yet another potentially-actionable therapeutic vulnerability to exploit in cancer-prone individuals with this genotype. Barnoud et al.

Although PCDH7 was recently shown to promote transformation and facilitate brain metastasis in lung and breast cancers, decreased PCDH7 expression has also been documented in colorectal, gastric, and invasive bladder cancers. These data suggest contextdependent functions for PCDH7 in distinct tumor types. Given that PCDH7 is a potentially targetable molecule on the surface of cancer cells, further investigation of its role in tumorigenesis in vivo is needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of its inhibition. Here, we report the analysis of novel PCDH7 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models and provide compelling evidence that this cell-surface protein acts as a potent lung cancer driver. Employing a Creinducible transgenic allele, we demonstrated that enforced PCDH7 expression significantly accelerates KrasG12D-driven lung tumorigenesis and potentiates MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, we performed in vivo somatic genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 in KrasLSL-G12D; Tp53fl/fl (KP) mice to assess the consequences of PCDH7 loss of function. Inactivation of PCDH7 in KP mice significantly reduced lung tumor development, prolonged survival, and diminished phospho-activation of ERK1/2. Together, these findings establish a critical oncogenic function for PCDH7 in vivo and highlight the therapeutic potential of PCDH7 inhibition for lung cancer. Moreover, given recent reports of elevated or reduced PCDH7 in distinct tumor types, the new inducible transgenic model described here provides a robust experimental system for broadly elucidating the effects of PCDH7 overexpression in vivo. Implications: In this study, we establish a critical oncogenic function for PCDH7 in vivo using novel mouse models and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and we validate the therapeutic potential of PCDH7 inhibition for lung cancer. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060929180

To describe the nature of this research, provide a benchmark, and map new directions for the future, a portfolio analysis of National Institutes of Health-wide survivorship grants was undertaken for fiscal year 2016. Applying survivorship-relevant terms, a search was conducted using the National Institutes of Health Information for Management, Planning, Analysis and Coordination grants database. Grants identified were reviewed for inclusion and categorized by grant mechanism used, funding agency, and principal investigator characteristics. Trained pairs of coders classified each grant by focus and design (observational vs interventional), population studied, and outcomes examined. A total of 215 survivorship grants were identified; 7 were excluded for lack of fit and 2 for nonresearch focus. Forty-one (19.7%) representing training grants (n = 38) or conference grants (n = 3) were not coded. Of the remaining 165 grants, most (88.5%) were funded by the National Cancer Institute; used the large, investigator-initiated (R01) mechanism (66.7%); focused on adult survivors alone (84.2%), often breast cancer survivors (47.3%); were observational in nature (57.3%); and addressed a broad array of topics, including psychosocial and physiologic outcomes, health behaviors, patterns of care, and economic/employment outcomes. Grants were led by investigators from diverse backgrounds, 28.4% of whom were early in their career. Present funding patterns, many stable since 2006, point to the need to expand research to include different cancer sites, greater ethnoculturally diverse samples, and older (>65 years) as well as longer-term (>5 years) survivors and address effects of newer therapies.

To identify functional drivers of melanoma, we searched for cross-species conserved mutations utilizing a mouse melanomamodel driven by loss of PTEN and CDKN2A, and identified mutations in Kras, Erbb3, and Ptpn11. PTPN11 encodes the SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway. Although PTPN11 is an oncogene in leukemia, lung, and breast cancers, its roles in melanoma are not clear. In this study, we found that PTPN11 is frequently activated in human melanoma specimens and cell lines and is required for full RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling activation in BRAF wild-type (either NRAS mutant or wild-type) melanoma cells. PTPN11 played oncogenic roles in melanoma by driving anchorage-independent colony formation and tumor growth. In Pten- and Cdkn2a-null mice, tet-inducible and melanocytespecific PTPN11 E76K expression significantly enhanced melanoma tumorigenesis. Melanoma cells derived from this mouse model showed doxycycline-dependent tumor growth in nude mice. Silencing PTPN11 E76K expression by doxycycline withdrawal caused regression of established tumors by induction of apoptosis and senescence, and suppression of proliferation. Moreover, the PTPN11 inhibitor (SHP099) also caused regression of NRAS Q61K -mutant melanoma. Using a quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics approach, we identified GSK3α/ β as one of the key substrates that were differentially tyrosinephosphorylated in these experiments modulating PTPN11. This study demonstrates that PTPN11 plays oncogenic roles in melanoma and regulates RAS and GSK3β signaling pathways.

RECENT FINDINGS: PARP inhibitors have been most studied in patients with breast and ovarian cancers associated with deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, though their role has expanded to include use as maintenance therapy in women with platinum-sensitive high-grade serous ovarian cancer due to the high propensity of such cancers to have defects in DNA repair by homologous recombination. As mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance are elucidated, rationale combination strategies can be devised to extend therapeutic benefits and to abrogate resistance. SUMMARY: Mechanisms of resistance include restoration of homologous recombination repair proficiency, loss of cancer cell reliance on PARP, and increased intracellular signaling through cell growth pathways.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058896906

Their safety profiles, however, are different. For example, neutropenia is observed at varying incidences in patients treated with these drugs; however, it is the most common adverse event for palbociclib and ribociclib, whereas diarrhea is the most common adverse event observed in patients treated with abemaciclib. To understand the mechanism of diarrhea observed with these drugs and in an effort to guide the development of safer drugs, we compared the effects of oral administration of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib on the gastrointestinal tract of rats using doses intended to produce comparable CDK4/6 inhibition. Rats administered abemaciclib, but not palbociclib or ribociclib, had fecal alterations, unique histopathologic findings, and distinctive changes in intestinal gene expression. Morphologic changes in the intestine were characterized by proliferation of crypt cells, loss of goblet cells, poorly differentiated and degenerating enterocytes with loss of microvilli, and mucosal inflammation. In the jejunum of abemaciclib-treated rats, downregulation of enterocyte membrane transporters and upregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation were observed, consistent with activation of the Wnt pathway and downstream transcriptional regulation. Among these CDK4/6 inhibitors, intestinal toxicity was unique to rats treated with abemaciclib, suggesting a mechanism of toxicity not due to primary pharmacology (CDK4/6 inhibition), but to activity at secondary pharmacologic targets. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85061059088

Humans are exposed to these hormones when cow milk is consumed, and this may explain the observed association between cow milk consumption and several hormone-sensitive cancers. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate whether cow milk consumption is associated with an increase in urinary excretion of sex steroid hormones and their metabolites in humans. Methods We conducted a randomized crossover intervention feeding experiment. A total of 109 postmenopausal women consumed 1 L of semiskimmed milk (1.5% fat) per day for 4 d and 1 L of whole milk (3.5% fat) per day for 4 d, intersected by 4-d wash-out periods. Sex steroid hormone levels were measured in 24-h urine samples collected at the end of each intervention and wash-out period. Results Estrogens, androgens, and progesterone were detected in the examined milk samples used for our intervention. Although a very high proportion of the estrogens were conjugated, only small proportions of the androgens and progesterone were conjugated. Milk consumption resulted in a significant increase in urinary estrone (E1) excretion, whereas estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 16ketoE2 excretion only increased after semiskimmed milk consumption. Urinary pregnanediol glucuronide excretion was not significantly affected. Conclusion Cow milk consumption increases urinary excretion of E1 in humans. Ingestion of semiskimmed milk appears also to raise E2, E3, and 16ketoE2 excretion, but future studies need to confirm these associations.

No modern case series of carcinocythemia exists in the literature. Methods: Blood smears from carcinocythemia patients were reviewed and associated clinicopathologic findings described and compared to the literature. When available, bone marrows were examined. Results: We identified 7 carcinocythemia cases over 3 years at our institution in 5 females and 2 males with a median age of 57 and compare them to 26 case reports in the literature (19 females, 10 males; median age 57). The primary neoplasms were carcinomas of breast (3 cases), lung, non-small cell (2 cases), prostate (1), and 1 case of unknown primary. Circulating tumor cells were associated with fragmentation hemolysis (2 cases), asplenic RBC changes (3 cases), and myeloid antigen expression by flow cytometry (2 cases) and were most commonly found at the feathered edge of the slide (6 cases) as single cells or in clusters. Conclusions: This represents the largest series of carcinocythemia reported. The identification of 7 cases at one institution over a 3-year period suggests carcinocythemia may becoming more common. Raising awareness of this entity and its associated clinicopathologic findings may help avoid diagnostic pitfalls in blood smear examinations and may guide timely clinical management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85053471510

Although Adriamycin causes DNA damage, data from Comet assays revealed that CFM-4.16 also induced DNA damage. Phosphorylation of histone 2AX (γH2AX) protein is involved in regulating DNA damage repair and apoptosis signaling. Adriamycin or CFM-4.16 treatments inhibited cell growth and caused elevated CARP-1 and γH2AX in human breast (HBC) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. In fact, a robust nuclear or peri-nuclear co-localization of CARP-1 and γH2AX occurred in cells undergoing apoptosis. Knock-down of CARP-1 diminished γH2AX, their co-localization, and apoptosis in CFM-4.16-or Adriamycin-treated cells. We found that CARP-1 directly binds with H2AX, and H2AX interacted with CARP-1, but not CARP-1 (∆600–652) mutant. Moreover, cells expressing CARP-1 (∆600–652) mutant were resistant to apoptosis, and had diminished levels of γH2AX, when compared with cells expressing wild-type CARP-1. Mutagenesis studies revealed that H2AX residues 1–35 harbored a CARP-1-binding epitope, while CARP-1 amino acids 636–650 contained an H2AX-interacting epitope. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that CARP-1 (636–650) peptide bound with H2AX (1–35) peptide with a dissociation constant (K d ) of 127 nM. Cells expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP)-tagged H2AX (1–35) peptide or EGFP-tagged CARP-1 (636–650) peptide were resistant to inhibition by Adriamycin or CFM-4.16.

Participants were separated into 3 groups: no prior chemotherapy exposure (CON, n = 6), and recent treatment with taxane- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with no/mild symptoms of CIPN (−CIPN, n = 8) or moderate/severe symptoms of CIPN (+CIPN, n = 6). Postural control was assessed by measuring center of pressure during standing balance conditions that systematically interfered with somatosensory, visual, and/or vestibular information. The presence of CIPN sensory symptoms was associated with impaired postural control, particularly during eyes-closed balance conditions (P <.05). Additionally, medial-lateral postural instability was more pronounced in the +CIPN group compared with the −CIPN group and CON participants (P <.05). Greater postural instability during eyes-closed balance in individuals with CIPN is consistent with impaired peripheral sensation. Balance impairments in cancer survivors with CIPN demonstrate the unique challenges in this population and motivate the need for targeted efforts to mitigate postural control deficits that have previously been associated with fall risk. © The Author(s) 2019.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061273237

Design Prospective, ongoing cohort study of university graduates. Settings The Spanish SUN project (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra, University of Navarra Follow-up), starting from 1999. Participants A total of 18 429 participants. Methods Information from participants is collected every 2 years by validated questionnaires. We assessed three dietary patterns (the Mediterranean, the Western and the Provegetarian dietary patterns). The rate advancement period (RAP) was used to assess the healthiness of each pattern (considering the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer or type 2 diabetes). We also assessed environmental footprints and monetary costs of each dietary pattern. Results After a median follow-up of 10.1 years, we identified 469 incident cases of the composite endpoint. The Mediterranean dietary pattern exhibited the best RAP (3.10 years gained [95% CI 4.35 to 1.85] for the highest vs the lowest quartile), while the Western pattern was the unhealthiest pattern (1.33 years lost when comparing extreme quartiles). In a scale between 4 and 16 of harmful environmental effects (the lower, the more environmentally friendly), the Provegetarian pattern scored best (8.82 [95% CI 8.75 to 8.88] when comparing extreme quartiles), whereas the Western pattern was the most detrimental pattern (10.80 [95% CI 10.72 to 10.87]). Regarding monetary costs, the Western pattern was the most affordable pattern (€5.87/day [95% CI 5.82 to 5.93], for the upper quartile), while the Mediterranean pattern was the most expensive pattern (€7.52/day [95% CI 7.47 to 7.56]). The Mediterranean dietary pattern was the most overall sustainable option, closely followed by the Provegetarian pattern. The least overall sustainable pattern was the Western dietary pattern. Conclusion Following plant-based diets, like the Mediterranean or Provegetarian dietary patterns, could be a good option in order to achieve an overall sustainable diet.

Immunohistochemistry is required to confirm cutaneous origin, and is also used for detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases of MCC. Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) expression is commonly used for these purposes, but is negative in some MCC cases, and has unclear specificity. We evaluated immunohistochemistry for neurofilament and CK20 in MCC compared with SmCC from other sites. Methods and results: We evaluated neurofilament expression in 55 MCC specimens from 39 unique patients, including nine CK20-negative MCC tumours. Neurofilament expression was observed in 42 of 55 (76.4%) MCC cases, including seven of nine (77.8%) CK20-negative MCC cases. Neurofilament was expressed in nine of 12 (75%) Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive tumours and five of 10 (50%) virus-negative tumours. Compared to a standard immunohistochemical panel (cytokeratin cocktail and CK20), neurofilament was 87.5% sensitive for detecting SLN metastases. Neurofilament and CK20 expression was also assessed in 61 extracutaneous SmCC from 60 unique patients, with primary sites including lung (27), bladder (18), cervix (3), gastrointestinal tract (3), sinonasal tract (2) and other sites (7). The specificity of neurofilament and CK20 for MCC versus non-cutaneous SmCC was 96.7% and 59.0%, respectively. Conclusions: Neurofilament has superior specificity to CK20 in distinguishing MCC from non-cutaneous SmCC. Neurofilament is frequently expressed in CK20- and virus-negative MCC tumours. Limitations of neurofilament immunohistochemistry include lower sensitivity than CK20 and subtle staining in some tumours. However, our findings indicate that neurofilament is useful for excluding non-cutaneous SmCC. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85057750355

Using these conventional methods, the structural patterns or textural components of the breast tissue elements are not considered or ignored entirely. This study presents a novel method to predict breast cancer risk that combines new texture and mammographic density based image features. We performed a comprehensive study of the correlation of 944 new and conventional texture and mammographic density features with breast cancer risk on a cohort of Asian women. We studied 250 breast cancer cases and 250 controls matched at full-field digital mammography (FFDM) status for age, BMI and ethnicity. Stepwise regression analysis identified relevant features to be included in a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier model, trained and tested using a leave-one-out based cross-validation method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used as the two performance assessment indices in our study. For the LDA trained classifier, the adjusted OR was 6.15 (95% confidence interval: 3.55-10.64) and for Volpara volumetric breast density, 1.10 (0.67-1.81). The AUC for the LDA trained classifier was 0.68 (0.64-0.73), compared to 0.52 (0.47-0.57) for Volpara volumetric breast density (p < 0.001). The regression analysis of OR values for the LDA classifier also showed a significant increase in slope (p < 0.02). Mammographic texture features derived from digital mammograms are important quantitative measures for breast cancer risk assessment based models. Parenchymal texture analysis has an important role for stratifying breast cancer risk in women, which can be implemented to routine breast cancer screening strategies. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060941686

However, driver gene discovery is a very challenging task because we are not only dealing with huge amount of data; but we are also faced with the complexity of the disease including the heterogeneity of background somatic mutation rate in each cancer patient. It is generally accepted that CDG harbor variants conferring growth advantage in the malignant cell and they are positively selected, which are critical to cancer development; whereas, non-driver genes harbor random mutations with no functional consequence on cancer. Based on this fact, function prediction based approaches for identifying CDG have been proposed to interrogate the distribution of functional predictions among mutations in cancer genomes (eLS 1-16, 2016). Assuming most of the observed mutations are passenger mutations and given the quantitative predictions for the functional impact of the mutations, genes enriched of functional or deleterious mutations are more likely to be drivers. The promises of these methods have been continually refined and can therefore be applied to increase accuracy in detecting new candidate CDGs. However, current function prediction based approaches only focus on coding mutations and lack a systematic way to pick the best mutation deleteriousness prediction algorithms for usage. Results: In this study, we propose a new function prediction based approach to discover CDGs through a gene-based permutation approach. Our method not only covers both coding and non-coding regions of the genes; but it also accounts for the heterogeneous mutational context in cohort of cancer patients. The permutation model was implemented independently using seven popular deleteriousness prediction scores covering splicing regions (SPIDEX), coding regions (MetaLR, and VEST3) and pan-genome (CADD, DANN, Fathmm-MKL coding and Fathmm-MKL noncoding). We applied this new approach to somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from whole-genome sequences of 119 breast and 24 lung cancer patients and compared the seven deleteriousness prediction scores for their performance in this study. Conclusion: The new function prediction based approach not only predicted known cancer genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census (CGC), but also new candidate CDGs that are worth further investigation. The results showed the advantage of utilizing pan-genome deleteriousness prediction scores in function prediction based methods. Although VEST3 score, a deleteriousness prediction score for missense mutations, has the best performance in breast cancer, it was topped by CADD and Fathmm-MKL coding, two pan-genome deleteriousness prediction scores, in lung cancer. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060860961

Preclinical studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of H3B-6545 in rat and monkeys. Methods: The clearance and metabolic profiles of H3B-6545 were studied using rat, monkey and human hepatocytes, and reaction phenotyping was done using recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Blood stability, protein binding, and permeability were also determined in vitro. Pharmacokinetics of H3B-6545 was assessed after both intravenous and oral dosing. A nonclinical PBPK model was developed to assess in vitro–in vivo correlation of clearance. Results: H3B-6545 had a terminal elimination half-life of 2.4 h in rats and 4.0 h in monkeys and showed low to moderate bioavailability, in line with the in vitro permeability assessment. Plasma protein binding was similar across species, at 99.5–99.8%. Nine metabolites of H3B-6545 were identified in hepatocyte incubations, none of which were unique to humans. Formation of glutathione-related conjugate of H3B-6545 was minimal in vitro. H3B-6545, a CYP3A substrate, is expected to be mostly cleared via hepatic phase 1 metabolism. Hepatocyte clearance values were used to adequately model the time-concentration profiles in rat and monkey. Conclusions: We report on the absorption and metabolic fate and disposition of H3B-6545 in rats and dogs and illustrate that in vitro–in vivo correlation of clearance is possible for targeted covalent inhibitors, provided reactivity is not a predominant mechanism of clearance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055983707

A recent study screened for the response of a thousand human cancer cell lines to a wide collection of anti-cancer drugs and illuminated the link between cellular genotypes and vulnerability. However, due to essential differences between cell lines and tumors, to date the translation into predicting drug response in tumors remains challenging. Recently, advances in deep learning have revolutionized bioinformatics and introduced new techniques to the integration of genomic data. Its application on pharmacogenomics may fill the gap between genomics and drug response and improve the prediction of drug response in tumors. Results: We proposed a deep learning model to predict drug response (DeepDR) based on mutation and expression profiles of a cancer cell or a tumor. The model contains three deep neural networks (DNNs), i) a mutation encoder pre-trained using a large pan-cancer dataset (The Cancer Genome Atlas; TCGA) to abstract core representations of high-dimension mutation data, ii) a pre-trained expression encoder, and iii) a drug response predictor network integrating the first two subnetworks. Given a pair of mutation and expression profiles, the model predicts IC 50 values of 265 drugs. We trained and tested the model on a dataset of 622 cancer cell lines and achieved an overall prediction performance of mean squared error at 1.96 (log-scale IC 50 values). The performance was superior in prediction error or stability than two classical methods (linear regression and support vector machine) and four analog DNN models of DeepDR, including DNNs built without TCGA pre-training, partly replaced by principal components, and built on individual types of input data. We then applied the model to predict drug response of 9059 tumors of 33 cancer types. Using per-cancer and pan-cancer settings, the model predicted both known, including EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer, and novel drug targets, such as vinorelbine for TTN-mutated tumors. The comprehensive analysis further revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to a chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel in a pan-cancer setting and the anti-cancer potential of a novel agent, CX-5461, in treating gliomas and hematopoietic malignancies. Conclusions: Here we present, as far as we know, the first DNN model to translate pharmacogenomics features identified from in vitro drug screening to predict the response of tumors. The results covered both well-studied and novel mechanisms of drug resistance and drug targets. Our model and findings improve the prediction of drug response and the identification of novel therapeutic options. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060888393

Thus, it is unclear to what degree BI debris compromises the long-term biological performance of BIs. For orthopedic implants, it is well established that the severity of biological reactivity to implant debris governs long-term clinical performance. Orthopedic implant particulate debris is generally in the range of 0.01 to 100 μm in diameter. Implant debris-induced bioreactivity/inflammation is mostly a peri-implant phenomenon caused by local innate immune cells (eg, macrophages) that produce proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and prostaglandin 2 (PGE2). In orthopedics, there have been few systemic concerns associated with polymeric implant debris (like silicone) other than documented dissemination to remote organs (eg, liver, spleen, etc.) with no known associated pathogenicity. This is not true of metal implant debris where normal (well-functioning) implants can induce systemic reactions such as delayed type hypersensitivity. Diagnostic analysis of orthopedic tissues has focused on innate (macrophage mediated) and adaptive (lymphocyte-mediated hypersensitivity) immune responses. Orthopedic implant debris-associated lymphocyte cancers have not been reported in over 40 years of orthopedic literature. Adaptive immune responses such as hypersensitivity reactions to orthopedic implant debris have been dominated by certain implant types that produce specific kinds of debris (eg, metal-on-metal total joint prostheses). Orthopedic hypersensitivity responses and atypical BI bioreactivity such as BI-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma share crossover markers for diagnosis. Differentiating normal innate immune reactivity to particles from anaplastic large cell lymphoma reactions from delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to BI-associated implant debris remains unclear but vital to patients and surgeons. © 2019 The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061067563

The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of machine learning with quantitative ultrasound image features for the diagnosis of TN breast cancer. Methods: Ultrasonic and clinical data of 140 surgically confirmed breast cancer cases were analyzed retrospectively for the diagnosis of TN and non-TN (NTN) subtypes. The subtypes were classified based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Ultrasound image features were measured from the grayscale and color Doppler images and used with logistic regression for classification by machine learning. Leave-one-out cross validation was used to train and test the differentiation. Diagnostic performance was measured by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and sensitivity and specificity determined at the Youdons index. Results: Of the twelve grayscale and Doppler features measured, eight were found to be statistically different for the TN and NTN subtypes (p < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the statistically significant grayscale (GS) and color Doppler (CD) features was 0.85 and 0.65, respectively. The AUC increased to 0.88 when the GS and CD features were used together, with sensitivity of 86.96% and specificity of 82.91%.

This study was performed to assess patterns and outcomes of BCT for T3 tumors. Methods: We reviewed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for noninflammatory breast cancers > 5 cm, between 2004 and 2011 who underwent BCT or mastectomy (Mtx) with nodal evaluation. Patients with skin or chest wall involvement were excluded. Patients having clinical T3 tumors were analyzed to determine outcomes based upon presentation, with those having pathologic T3 tumors, subsequently assessed, irrespective of presentation. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, with adjusted survival curves estimated using inverse probability weighting. Results: After exclusions, 37,268 patients remained. Median age and tumor size for BCT versus Mtx were 53 versus 54 years (p < 0.001) and 6.0 versus 6.7 cm (p < 0.001), respectively. Predictors of BCT included age, race, location, facility type, year of diagnosis, tumor size, grade, histology, nodes examined and positive, and administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. OS was similar between Mtx and BCT (p = 0.36). This held true when neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients were excluded (p = 0.39). BCT percentages declined over time (p < 0.001), while tumor sizes remained the same (p = 0.77). Median follow-up was 51.4 months. Conclusions: OS for patients with T3 breast cancers is similar whether patients received Mtx or BCT, confirming that tumor size should not be an absolute BCT exclusion. Declining use of BCT for tumors > 5 cm in younger patients may be accounted for by recent trends toward mastectomy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055751666

BCI identified a subset of RS low and intermediate risk patients with clinically relevant elevated rates of distant recurrences (DR). The current study analyzed the correlation of BCI and RS risk classification to clinical and pathological parameters and further examined the re-categorization between the two risk group indices in a multi-institutional cohort of hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients. Methods: 560 women with HR+, lymph node-negative breast cancer who underwent testing with RS as part of their routine clinical care were included in the final analysis. Individual risk was assessed using predefined categories of RS and BCI (Low, Intermediate and High, respectively). Correlations between BCI, RS, and standard clinical-pathological prognostic factors were examined, and re-categorization of risk groups between BCI and RS was analyzed. Results: An overall significant association between histological tumor grade and RS or BCI was observed with high-grade tumors more prevalent among RS and BCI high-risk patients. The invasive ductal carcinoma histologic subtype was associated with 98% and 93% of high-risk RS and BCI cases, respectively. The invasive lobular subtype accounted for 0% and 6% of high-risk RS and BCI cases, respectively. A poor agreement between the two biomarker risk group indices was demonstrated with more than 51% of the total cohort stratified differently between BCI and RS. As compared with RS, BCI stratified fewer patients into the intermediate-risk group (29% vs. 39%, BCI and RS, respectively) and more patients into the high-risk group (19% vs. 7%, BCI and RS, respectively). Subsets of both RS low- and intermediate-risk patients were identified by BCI as high risk. Conclusions: In this clinical series, BCI and RS risk groups demonstrated a significant association with histological tumor grade. BCI showed a modest correlation with tumor size and no correlation with age, while RS showed no correlation with tumor size or age. Compared with RS, BCI classifies fewer intermediate risk patients, identifies subsets of low and intermediate RS risk patients as high-risk, and provides distinct individualized risk assessment for patients with early-stage breast cancer. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055559303

The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has come under scrutiny after prospective clinical trials using recombinant erythropoietin to correct anemia reported increased incidence of thromboembolic events and cancer-related deaths. Furthermore, previous preclinical reports indicated expansion of the pool of breast cancer-initiating cells when erythropoietin was combined with ionizing radiation. Methods: Using four established breast cancer cell lines, we test the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin and the number of breast cancer-initiating cells in vitro and in vivo and study if recombinant human erythropoietin promotes the phenotype conversion of non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells into breast cancer-initiating cells. In a prospective study, we evaluate whether elevated endogenous serum erythropoietin levels correlate with increased numbers of tumor-initiating cells in a cohort of breast cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo radiation treatment. Results: Our results indicate that recombinant erythropoietin increased the number of tumor-initiating cells in established breast cancer lines in vitro. Irradiation of breast cancer xenografts caused a phenotype conversion of non-stem breast cancer cells into induced breast cancer-initiating cells. This effect coincided with re-expression of the pluripotency factors c-Myc, Sox2, and Oct4 and was enhanced by recombinant erythropoietin. Hemoglobin levels were inversely correlated with serum erythropoietin levels, and the latter were correlated with disease stage. However, tumor sections revealed a negative correlation between serum erythropoietin levels and the number of ALDH1A3-positive cells, a marker for breast cancer-initiating cells. Conclusions: We conclude that physiologically slow-rising serum erythropoietin levels in response to tumor-related or chemotherapy-induced anemia, as opposed to large doses of recombinant erythropoietin, do not increase the pool of breast cancer-initiating cells. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060888183

However, the pathogenesis, optimal therapy, and prognosis of MpBC and the potential effect of systemic treatments on different subtypes of MpBC are not well defined. Methods: A retrospective population-based study was performed to identify breast cancer patients with MpBC and other triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) between 2010 and 2014 using the surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Chi-square test was used to analyze characteristics between subgroups. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Multivariate Cox regressions were used to evaluate overall survival (OS) of MpBC, TNBC, and MpBC subgroups. Competing risk analysis and multivariate regression model of competing risk were used to assess breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of MpBC and TNBC Results: We identified a study cohort of 22,433 patients (1112 MpBC and 21,321 TNBC). MpBC correlated with older population, larger tumor size and less lymph node involvement, and TNBC phenotype. Patients with MpBC especially with triple-negative subtype (TN-MpBC) had worse survival than the overall TNBC population. However, the prognosis of MpBC without triple-negative subtype (non-TN MpBC) was not different from that of TNBC. In Kaplan–Meier analysis, chemotherapy was not associated with significant difference in OS of TN-MpBC. In non-TN MpBC group, the 3-year OS was 79.8% for patients receiving chemotherapy and 70.5% in patients without chemotherapy, and chemotherapy was associated (P = 0.033) with improved OS. Within the MpBC patients, radiotherapy was significantly (HR 1.544; 95% CI 1.148–2.078; P = 0.004) associated with improved OS and (HR 1.474; 95% CI 1.067–2.040; P = 0.019) BCSS. Conclusions: Patients with TN-MpBC had worse prognosis than TNBC and chemotherapy was not associated with improved survival. In contrast, non-TN MpBC may derive survival benefit from chemotherapy and radiotherapy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055718391

One protein highly expressed in mucin secreting breast cancers is the secreted mucin, Mucin 2 (MUC2). While MUC2 is expressed in some breast cancers it is absent in normal breast tissue, implicating it in breast cancer. However, the effects of MUC2 on breast cancer are largely unknown. This study examined the role of MUC2 in modulating breast cancer proliferation, response to chemotherapy and metastasis. Methods: Using patient derived xenografts we developed two novel cell lines, called BCK4 and PT12, which express high levels of MUC2. To modulate MUC2 levels, BCK4 and PT12 cells were engineered to express shRNA targeted to MUC2 (shMUC2, low MUC2) or a non-targeting control (shCONT, high MUC2) and proliferation and apoptosis were measured in vitro and in vivo. BCK4 cells with shCONT or shMUC2 were labeled with GFP-luciferase and examined in an experimental metastasis model; disease burden and site specific dissemination were monitored by intravital imaging and fluorescence guided dissection, respectively. Results: Proliferation decreased in BCK4 and PT12 shMUC2 cells versus control cells both in vitro and in vivo. Chemotherapy induced minimal apoptosis in control cells expressing high MUC2 but increased apoptosis in shMUC2 cells containing low MUC2. An experimental metastasis model showed disease burden decreased when breast cancer cells contained low versus high MUC2. Treatment with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) increased MUC2 expression in BCK4 cells; this induction was abolished by the EGF-receptor inhibitor, Erlotinib. Conclusions: MUC2 plays an important role in mediating proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis of breast cancer cells. MUC2 may be important in guiding treatment and predicting outcomes in breast cancer patients. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062075459

This study, the largest to date, compared outcomes of three evidence-based, 12-week therapies in treating major depressive disorder among women with breast cancer. Methods: This randomized trial compared interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), problem solving therapy (PST), and brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP). Conducted at the outpatient clinic of the New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University, the trial offered bilingual treatment by treatment-specific psychotherapists supervised by treatment experts. The primary outcome was change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included other validated patient-reported outcomes for depression and quality of life. Results: Of 179 women with breast cancer screening positive for depression at the Columbia Cancer Center, 134 eligible patients signed informed treatment consent. Half of patients were Hispanic and economically disadvantaged. Most women had stage I (35.2%) or II (36.9%) BC; 9% had stage IV. The three brief psychotherapies showed similar improvements on the HAM-D, with large pre-post effect sizes (d ~ 1.0); a priori defined response rates were 35% for IPT, 50% for PST and 31% for BSP, and remission rates 25%, 30% and 27%, respectively. The three treatments also showed similar improvements in the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Dropout was high, ranging from 37 to 52% across treatments. Predictors of dropout included having < 16 years of education and annual family income < $20,000. Conclusions: Among patients who completed treatment, all three psychotherapies were associated with similar, meaningful improvements in depression. Physical distance between the oncology and psychiatric treatment sites might have contributed to high dropout. This study suggests various psychotherapy approaches may benefit patients with breast cancer and major depression. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055691899

We studied the association between fat mass (kg and relative to total body weight) as well as lean mass (kg and relative to total body weight) and toxicity-induced modifications of treatment in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Methods: In an observational study among 172 breast cancer patients (stage I–IIIB) in the Netherlands, we assessed body composition using dual-energy X-ray scans. Information on toxicity-induced modifications of treatment, defined as dose reductions, cycle delays, regimen switches, or premature termination of chemotherapy, was abstracted from medical records. Adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to assess associations between body composition and the risk of toxicity-induced modifications of treatment. Results: In total, 95 out of 172 (55%) patients experienced toxicity-induced modifications of treatment. Higher absolute and relative fat mass were associated with higher risk of these modifications (HR 1.14 per 5 kg; 95% CI 1.04–1.25 and HR 1.21 per 5%; 95% CI 1.05–1.38, respectively). A higher relative lean mass was associated with a lower risk of modifications (HR 0.83 per 5%; 95% CI 0.72–0.96). There was no association between absolute lean mass and risk of toxicity-induced modifications of treatment. Conclusions: A higher absolute and a higher relative fat mass was associated with an increased risk of toxicity-induced modifications of treatment. Absolute lean mass was not associated with risk of these treatment modifications, while higher relative lean mass associated with lower risk of modifications. These data suggest that total fat mass importantly determines the risk of toxicities during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. © 2018, The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85055738655

Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer rely on chromatin remodeling and association with epigenetic factors in inducing ER-dependent oncogenesis and thus cell over-proliferation. The mechanistic differences between epigenetic regulation and hormone signaling provide an avenue for combination therapy of ER-positive breast cancer. We hypothesized that epigenetic biomarkers within single nucleosome proximity of ER-dependent genes could serve as potential therapeutic targets. We described here a Fluorescence lifetime imaging-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) methodology for biomarker screening that could facilitate combination therapy based on our study. We screened 11 epigenetic-related markers which include oxidative forms of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and methyl-binding domain proteins.

When histone acetyltransferase inhibitor targeting H4K12ac and H3K27ac was combined with tamoxifen, an enhanced therapeutic outcome was observed against ER-positive breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo.

We utilized novel robot-assisted measures of shoulder stiffness and strength to dissociate how breast reconstruction choice and inclusion of radiation therapy impact shoulder morbidity in post-mastectomy reconstruction patients. Methods: Shoulder strength and stiffness were collected from 10 irradiated LD flap breast reconstruction patients, 14 two-stage subpectoral implant reconstruction patients (subpectoral), and 10 irradiated deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap patients an average of 659 days post-reconstruction. Univariate ANOVAs examined surgical group differences in strength and stiffness. Results: There were main effects of surgical group on vertical adduction, vertical abduction, and internal rotation strength. The LD flap group was significantly weaker than the subpectoral group in all measures and significantly weaker than the DIEP group during vertical adduction. There was also a main effect of surgical group on vertical adduction stiffness, where the LD group exhibited significantly reduced stiffness while producing vertical adduction torque. No significant differences between the subpectoral and DIEP groups existed for any measure of shoulder strength or stiffness. Conclusions: Disinsertion of the LD, not the disinsertion of the PM or radiotherapy, contributes to strength deficits following LD flap breast reconstructions.

Successful translation of genomic medicine into clinical care will require that providers of this information are aware of the level of understanding, attitudes, perceived risks, benefits, and concerns of their patients. We used a mixed methods approach to conduct in-depth interviews with participants in the NCI-funded Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR). Our goal was to gain a better understanding of attitudes towards different types and amounts of genomic information, current interest in pursuing genomic testing, and perceived risks and benefits. We interviewed 32 women from the six BCFR sites in the USA, Canada, and Australia. In this sample of women with a personal or family history of breast cancer, we found high acknowledgement of the potential of genetics/genomics to improve their own health and that of their family members through lifestyle changes or alterations in their medical management. Respondents were more familiar with cancer genetics than the genetics of other diseases. Concerns about the testing itself included a potential sense of loss of control over health, feelings of guilt on passing on a mutation to a child, loss of privacy and confidentiality, questions about the test accuracy, and the potential uncertainty of the significance of test results. These data provide important insights into attitudes about the introduction of increasingly complex genetic testing, to inform interventions to prepare individuals for the introduction of this new technology into their clinical care. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85047435754

To address this in a community health setting a screening tool was created to identify high-risk women. This study evaluates the implementation of the tool and identifies opportunities for improved cancer genetic screening, including regular clinician education. A mixed-method approach was used to evaluate clinician utilization of the screening tool at Planned Parenthood affiliates. Novel surveys that evaluated acceptance and implementation were administered to clinicians (n = 14) and semi-structured interviews (n = 6) were used to explore clinicians’ perspectives and identify gaps in its utilization. Educational modules that addressed gaps were developed, implemented, and evaluated using a post-education survey (n = 8). Clinicians reported confidence in administering and interpreting the screening tool, but reported less confidence in their knowledge of cancer genetics and ability to connect clients with genetic counseling and testing (p =.003). Educational modules resulted in significant gains in clinician knowledge on genetic topics (p <.05) and increased self-reported confidence in connecting clients with genetic services. The modules reinforced the belief that genetic testing is beneficial for patients at increased risk (p =.001) and is important to inform subsequent medical management (p =.027). While building community clinicians’ capacity to connect clients with genetic services is crucial, it is challenged by knowledge and confidence gaps in discussions of genetic services with clients.

Methods: We present a 10-year series compiled in the Section of Neuro-Oncology, Yale Cancer Center between 2002 and 2012. Results: Twenty-five cases met the PNS Euro-network criteria for definitive PNS. Most (64%; 16/25) had no known neoplasm. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis declined logarithmically over time. Neuroimaging abnormalities were seen in 88% of cases (15/17), but with delayed onset. Therapeutic benefit correlated strongly to pre-treatment modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (p < 0.01), but not with time elapsed between syndrome onset to treatment (p = 0.8), first immunotherapy modality (corticosteroids: n = 10; IVIG: n = 10; PLEX: n = 3; p = 0.37), or number of immunotherapy modalities provided (p = 0.17). PNS-related mortality was high (24%; 6/25). Nonetheless, 16% (3/18; 7 living patients censored) survived over 6 times the anticipated median expected by tumor type and stage. Conclusions: PNS are rare, at an estimated incidence of 3.1 cases per million-person-years. Detection of CSF pleocytosis and MRI abnormalities depend on time of analysis. While PNS-related mortality was high, immunotherapy benefit correlated strongly with pre-treatment mRS and long-term survival is possible. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059678448

We evaluate the relationship between these outcomes and GEP testing. Methods: We surveyed women eligible for GEP testing (stage I or II, Gr1-2, ER+, HER2−) identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry of Washington or Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2012 to 2016, approximately 0–4 years from diagnosis (N = 904, RR = 45.4%). Confidence in chemotherapy was measured as confident (Very, completely) versus Not Confident (Somewhat, A little, Not At All); perceived risk recurrence was recorded numerically (0–100%). Women reported their GEP test receipt (Yes, No, Unknown) and risk recurrence score (High, Intermediate, Low, Unknown). In our analytic sample (N = 833), we propensity score weighted the three test receipt cohorts and used propensity weighted multivariable regressions to examine associations between the outcomes and the three test receipt cohorts, with receipt stratified by score. Results: 29.5% reported an unknown GEP test receipt; 86% being confident. Compared to no test receipt, an intermediate score (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.20–0.58), unknown score (aOR 0.09; 95% CI 0.05–0.18), and unknown test receipt (aOR 0.37; 95% CI 0.24–0.57) were less likely to report confidence. Most women greatly overestimated their recurrence risk regardless of their test receipt or score. Conclusions: GEP testing was not associated with greater confidence in chemotherapy decisions.

Lately, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, or vorinostat, MK0683) have been emerging as a new class of drugs with promising therapeutic benefits in controlling cancer growth and metastasis. The small molecule RG7388 (idasanutlin, R05503781) is a newly developed inhibitor that is specific for an oncogene-derived protein called MDM2, which is also in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancers. These two drugs have shown the ability to induce p21 expression through distinct mechanisms in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, which are reported to have wild-type TP53. Our understanding of the molecular mechanism whereby SAHA and RG7388 can induce cell cycle arrest and trigger cell death is still evolving. In this study, we performed experiments to measure the cell cycle arrest effects of SAHA and RG7388 using MCF-7 and LNCaP cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis/necroptosis effects of the SAHA and RG7388 treatments were assessed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion (TBDE) method, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, fluorescence assay with DEVD-amc substrate, and immunoblotting methods. RESULTS: The RG7388 treatment was able to induce cell death by elevating p21WAF1/CIP1 through inhibition of MDM2 in LNCaP, but not in MCF-7 cells, even though there was evidence of p53 elevation. Hence, we suspect that there is some level of uncoupling of p53-mediated transcriptional induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results from MCF-7 and LNCaP cells confirmed that SAHA and RG7388 treatments were able to induce cell death via a combination of cell cycle arrest and cytotoxic mechanisms. We speculate that our findings could lead to the development of newer treatments for breast and prostate cancers with drug combinations including HDACi.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060926568

HR deficiency can also arise in tumors without a BRCA1 mutation. Compared with other breast tumors, HR-deficient, BRCA1-like tumors exhibit worse prognosis but selective chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Presently, patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who do not respond to hormone endocrine-targeting therapy are given cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, more recent evidence showed a similar genomic profile between BRCA1-deficient TNBCs and hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Characterization of the somatic alterations of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive breast tumors as a group, which is currently lacking, can potentially help develop biomarkers for identifying additional patients who might respond to chemotherapy. Methods: We retrained and validated a copy-number-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify HR-deficient, BRCA1-like breast tumors. We applied this classifier to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) breast tumors. We assessed mutational profiles and proliferative capacity by covariate-adjusted linear models and identified differentially methylated regions using DMRcate in BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Results: Of the breast tumors in TCGA and METABRIC, 22% (651/2925) were BRCA1-like. Stratifying on hormone-receptor status, 13% (302/2405) receptor-positive and 69% (288/417) triple-negative tumors were BRCA1-like. Among the hormone-receptor-positive subgroup, BRCA1-like tumors showed significantly increased mutational burden and proliferative capacity (both P < 0.05). Genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of BRCA1-like tumors identified 202 differentially methylated gene regions, including hypermethylated BRCA1. Individually significant CpGs were enriched for enhancer regions (P < 0.05). The hypermethylated gene sets were enriched for DNA and chromatin conformation (all Bonferroni P < 0.05). Conclusions: To provide insights into alternative classification and potential therapeutic targeting strategies of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors we developed and applied a novel copy number classifier to identify BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors and their characteristic somatic alteration profiles. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",,2-s2.0-85060518440

Herein, we detail the synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a dipeptide library bearing Arg α-ketobenozothiazole (kbt) warheads as novel inhibitors of HGFA, matriptase, and hepsin. We elucidated the substrate specificity for HGFA using positional scanning of substrate combinatorial libraries (PS-SCL), which was used to discover selective inhibitors of matriptase and hepsin.

Because HER2 remains overexpressed in drug-resistant HER2-BC cells, we investigated whether PEPD G278D can overcome the resistance. PEPD G278D is a recombinant enzymatically inactive mutant of human peptidase D, which strongly inhibits HER2 in cancer cells by binding to its extracellular domain. Here, we show that PEPD G278D is highly active in preclinical models of HER2-BC resistant to Ttzm and other HER2 inhibitors and also enhances the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel. The therapeutic activity is underscored by its ability to bind to HER2 and free it from protection by mucin 4, disrupt its interplay with other receptor tyrosine kinases, and subsequently direct HER2 for degradation. PEPD G278D also down-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor, which contributes to drug resistance in HER2-BC. In contrast, Ttzm, whose therapeutic activity also depends on its binding to the extracellular domain of HER2, cannot perform any of these functions of PEPD G278D . PEPD G278D inhibits HER2-BC cells and tumors that carry clinically relevant molecular changes that confer resistance to Ttzm. Our results show that HER2 remains a critical target in drug-resistant HER2-BC and that PEPD G278D is a promising agent for overcoming drug resistance in this disease.

Microporous polysaccharide hemospheres (MPH) consists of hydrophilic, plant based, polysaccharide particles and is currently used as an absorbable hemostatic agent. An animal model evaluating MPH and seroma formation after mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection showed a significant decrease in seroma volume. Study aim was to evaluate topical MPH on the risk of post-mastectomy seroma formation as measured by total drain output and total drain days. Methods: Prospective randomized single-blinded clinical trial of patients undergoing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. MPH was applied to the surgical site in the study group and no application in the control group. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled; eight were excluded due to missing data. Forty-two patients were evaluated, control (n = 21) vs. MPH (n = 21). No difference was identified between the two groups regarding demographics, tumor stage, total drain days, total drain output, number of clinic visits, or complication rates. On a subset analysis, body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 was identified as an independent risk factor for high drain output. Post hoc analyses of MPH controlling for BMI also revealed no statistical difference. Conclusions: Unlike the data presented in an animal model, no difference was demonstrated in the duration and quantity of serosanguinous drainage related to the use of MPH in patients undergoing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. BMI greater than 30 was identified as an independent risk factor for high drain output and this risk was not affected by MPH use.

ORR was 62.5% (95% CI: 57.2–67.6%) in the PF-05280014 group and 66.5% (95% CI: 61.3–71.4%) in the trastuzumab-EU group. As of data cut-off on 11 January 2017 (using data up to 378 days post-randomisation), there were no notable differences between groups in progression-free survival (median: 12.16 months in the PF-05280014 group vs. 12.06 months in the trastuzumab-EU group; 1-year rate: 54% vs. 51%) or overall survival (median: not reached in either group; 1-year rate: 89.31% vs. 87.36%). Safety outcomes and immunogenicity were similar between the treatment groups. Conclusion: When given as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel demonstrated equivalence to trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel in terms of ORR.

Methods: This study investigated these and similar clinically relevant drug combinations in highly translational preclinical models of micro- and macro-metastatic disease that spontaneously develop after surgical resection of primary kidney or breast tumours derived from orthotopic implantation of murine cancer cell lines (RENCA luc or EMT-6/CDDP, respectively). Results: In the RENCA luc model, adjuvant sunitinib plus anti-PD-L1 improved overall survival compared to either drug alone, while the same combination was ineffective as early therapy for unresected primary tumours or late-stage therapy for advanced metastatic disease. In the EMT-6/CDDP model, anti-PD-L1 was highly effective as an adjuvant monotherapy, while its combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy (with or without anti-VEGF) was most effective as a neoadjuvant therapy. Conclusions: Our preclinical data suggest that anti-PD-L1 plus sunitinib may warrant further investigation as an adjuvant therapy for RCC, while anti-PD-L1 may be improved by combining with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant but not the adjuvant setting of treating breast cancer. © 2018, Cancer Research UK.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057609014

To begin investigating whether the role of estrogens in the etiology of breast cancer is similar in African-American (AA) women, a saliva sample and a spot urine sample were collected from 19 AA women with breast cancer and 23 AA women not diagnosed with breast cancer. In the urine samples, 20 estrogen metabolites, conjugates, and DNA adducts were analyzed by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and then the ratio of adducts to metabolites and conjugates was calculated for each sample. The ratio of depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts to estrogen metabolites and estrogen conjugates was significantly greater in cases compared to controls (92.4 ± 46.4 vs 38.5 ± 18.9, p < 0.0001). From the saliva samples, genomic DNA was purified and analyzed for genetic polymorphisms in the genes for two estrogen-metabolizing enzymes, catechol-O-methyltransferase (rs4680) and cytochrome P450 1B1 (rs1056836). There was no association between rs4680 and rs1056836 genotypes and adduct ratios or breast cancer status.

Molecular discordance between primary and metastatic TNBC has been observed, but the degree of biological heterogeneity has not been fully explored. Furthermore, genomic evolution through treatment is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to characterize the genomic changes between paired primary and metastatic TNBCs through transcriptomic and genomic profiling, and to identify genomic alterations which may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Methods: Genomic alterations and mRNA expression of 10 paired primary and metastatic TNBCs were determined through targeted sequencing, microarray analysis, and RNA sequencing. Commonly mutated genes, as well as differentially expressed and co-expressed genes were identified. We further explored the clinical relevance of differentially expressed genes between primary and metastatic tumors to patient survival using large public datasets. Results: Through gene expression profiling, we observed a shift in TNBC subtype classifications between primary and metastatic TNBCs. A panel of eight cancer driver genes (CCNE1, TPX2, ELF3, FANCL, JAK2, GSK3B, CEP76, and SYK) were differentially expressed in recurrent TNBCs, and were also overexpressed in TCGA and METABRIC. CCNE1 and TPX2 were co-overexpressed in TNBCs. DNA mutation profiling showed that multiple mutations occurred in genes comprising a number of potentially targetable pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/MAPK, cell cycle, and growth factor receptor signaling, reaffirming the wide heterogeneity of mechanisms driving TNBC. CCNE1 amplification was associated with poor overall survival in patients with metastatic TNBC. Conclusions: CCNE1 amplification may confer resistance to chemotherapy and is associated with poor overall survival in TNBC. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060220307

However, premature drug release from protein nanoparticles and high toxicity of QDs due to heavy metal leakage are among challenging hurdles. Following this platform, we developed cancer nano-theranostics by coupling biocompatible albumin backbone to CdTe QDs and mannose moieties to enhance tumor targeting and reduce QDs toxicity. The chemotherapeutic water soluble drug pemetrexed (PMT) was conjugated via tumor-cleavable bond to the albumin backbone for tumor site-specific release. In combination, the herbal hydrophobic drug resveratrol (RSV) was preformulated as phospholipid complex which enabled its physical encapsulation into albumin nanoparticles. Results: Albumin-QDs theranostics showed enhanced cytotoxicity and internalization into breast cancer cells that could be traced by virtue of their high fluorescence quantum yield and excellent imaging capacity. In vivo, the nanocarriers demonstrated superior anti-tumor effects including reduced tumor volume, increased apoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis in addition to non-immunogenic response. Moreover, in vivo bioimaging test demonstrated excellent tumor-specific accumulation of targeted nanocarriers via QDs-mediated fluorescence. Conclusion: Mannose-grafted strategy and QD-fluorescence capability were beneficial to deliver albumin nanocarriers to tumor tissues and then to release the anticancer drugs for killing cancer cells as well as enabling tumor imaging facility. Overall, we believe albumin-QDs nanoplatform could be a potential nano-theranostic for bioimaging and targeted breast cancer therapy. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060155029

A 20-year-old woman with breast cancer brain metastases received treatment with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), then salvage SRS 1.4 years later for progression of a previously treated metastasis. This lesion treated with SRS had hemorrhagic enlargement 3.0 years after SRS. Resection revealed a cavernous malformation. A 25-year-old woman had SRS for a brain metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma. Resection of a progressive, hemorrhagic lesion within the SRS field 2 years later revealed both recurrent carcinoma as well as cavernous malformation.

During metastasis, tumor cells enter the circulation to gain access to distant tissues, but how this fluid microenvironment influences cancer cell biology is poorly understood. Methods and results: Here, we present both in vivo and in vitro evidence that EMT-like transition also occurs in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a result of hydrodynamic shear stress (+SS), which promotes conversion of CD24 middle /CD44 high /CD133 middle /CXCR4 low /ALDH1 low primary patient epithelial tumor cells into specific high sphere-forming CD24 low /CD44 low /CD133 high /CXCR4 high /ALDH1 high cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) with elevated tumor progression and metastasis capacity in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that conversion of CSLCs/TICs from epithelial tumor cells via +SS is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS)/nitric oxide (NO) generation, and suppression of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β, a mechanism similar to that operating in embryonic stem cells to prevent their differentiation while promoting self-renewal. Conclusion: Fluid shear stress experienced during systemic circulation of human breast tumor cells can lead to specific acquisition of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like potential that promotes EMT, mesenchymal-epithelial transition, and metastasis to distant organs. Our data revealed that biomechanical forces appeared to be important microenvironmental factors that not only drive hematopoietic development but also lead to acquisition of CSLCs/TIC potential in cancer metastasis. Our data highlight that +SS is a critical factor that promotes the conversion of CTCs into distinct TICs in blood circulation by endowing plasticity to these cells and by maintaining their self-renewal signaling pathways. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060111832

Weight change at year 3 was categorized as stable (<5%), loss (≥5%), or gain (≥5%) with further assessment of weight loss intentionality by self-report. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate relationships between weight change and subsequent breast cancer incidence. Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.4 years with 3061 incident breast cancers, women with weight loss (n = 8175) had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared with women whose weight remained stable (n = 41,139) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.98; P =.02) with no interaction by BMI.

Materials and methods: From a pathology database search revealing 327 patients with metastatic lobular breast cancer at our institution from January 2004 through August 2014, imaging was available in 116 patients (age range, 31–87 years, mean age, 55). Simple descriptive statistics were performed to record and tabulate the abdominal metastatic spread. Prognostic significance of abdominal metastases and individual abdominal metastatic sites was studied using the Log-rank test and construction of Kaplan–Meier curves. Results: The most frequent sites of intra-abdominal metastatic invasive lobular breast cancer were peritoneum (55 patients, 47%), followed by liver (37 patients, 32%), bowel (34 patients, 29%), ovary (33 patients, 28%), retroperitoneum (16 patients, 14%), ureter (16 patients, 14%), and lymph nodes (15 patients, 13%). Bowel obstruction was noted in 15 patients (13%) and hydronephrosis in 25 patients (22%). The median abdominal metastasis-free survival was 76 months (interquartile range: 17–191).

We examined the degree to which persistent breast pain and experience as a cancer caregiver were related to cancer worry and perceived risk in first-degree relatives of women with breast cancer (N = 85) and how catastrophic thoughts about breast pain could impact these relationships. There was a significant interaction between persistent breast pain and pain catastrophizing in predicting cancer worry (p =.03); among women who engaged in pain catastrophizing, cancer worry remained high even in the absence of breast pain. Pain catastrophizing also moderated the relationships between caregiving involvement and cancer worry (p =.003) and perceived risk (p =.03). As the degree of caregiving responsibility increased, cancer worry and perceived risk increased for women who engaged in pain catastrophizing; levels of cancer worry and perceived risk remained low and stable for women who did not engage in pain catastrophizing regardless of caregiving experience.

The goal of the current study was to examine whether indicators of biological aging, namely elevated levels of DNA damage, reduced telomerase enzymatic activity, and shorter peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) telomere length (TL) would be related to cognitive function in a cohort of survivors of breast cancer. Methods: The authors evaluated a cross-sectional sample of 94 women aged 36 to 69 years who were treated for early-stage breast cancer 3 to 6 years previously. Leukocyte DNA damage, PBMC telomerase enzymatic activity, PBMC TL, and the inflammatory marker soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNF-RII) were determined from blood samples. Cognitive function was assessed using a neuropsychological test battery and self-report. Linear regression models examined the relationship between biological aging predictors and cognitive outcomes. Results: Both higher DNA damage and lower telomerase were found to be statistically significantly related to lower executive function scores adjusting for age, body mass index, race, years from treatment, and intelligence score (standardized coefficients [B], -0.23 and 0.30; all P values <.05). In addition, lower telomerase activity was associated with worse attention and motor speed scores (B values, 0.30 and 0.24; P &lt;.05). sTNF-RII and TL were found to be unrelated to any of the neurocognitive domains. Conclusions: The results of the current study suggest a significant association between measures of biological aging and objective measures of cognitive performance in survivors of breast cancer.

In this study, we sought to extend these characterizations with genomics approaches, particularly with cost-effective employment of exome files. Methods: By recovery of immune receptor recombination reads from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset, we observed associations of these recombinations with T-cell and B-cell biomarkers and with distinct survival rates. Results: Recovery of TRD or IGH recombination reads was associated with an improved disease-free survival (p = 0.047 and 0.045, respectively). Determination of the HLA types using the exome files allowed matching of T-cell receptor V- and J-gene segment usage with specific HLA alleles, in turn allowing a refinement of the association of immune receptor recombination read recoveries with survival. For example, the TRBV7, HLA-C*07:01 combination represented a significantly worse, disease-free outcome (p = 0.014) compared to all other breast cancer samples. By direct comparisons of distinct TRB gene segment usage, HLA allele combinations revealed breast cancer subgroups, within the entire TCGA breast cancer dataset with even more dramatic survival distinctions. Conclusions: In sum, the use of exome files for recovery of adaptive immune receptor recombination reads, and the simultaneous determination of HLA types, has the potential of advancing the use of immunogenomics for immune characterization of breast tumor samples. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053675922

To date, only retrospective studies have assessed the prognosis of patients with a pregnancy after prior early breast cancer, with no data in HER2-positive patients. Methods: The Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (NeoALTTO) trial and the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (ALTTO) trial were randomized phase 3 trials for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. In both trials, pregnancy information was prospectively collected. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between patients unintentionally exposed to trastuzumab and/or lapatinib during gestation (the exposed group) and those who became pregnant after trastuzumab and/or lapatinib completion (the unexposed group). In the ALTTO trial, disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between pregnant patients and those aged 40 years or younger without a subsequent pregnancy via an extended Cox model with time-varying covariates to account for a guarantee-time bias. Results: Ninety-two patients (12 in the exposed group and 80 in the unexposed group) had a pregnancy: 7 in the NeoALTTO trial and 85 in the ALTTO trial. Seven patients (58.3%) in the exposed group and 10 patients (12.5%) in the unexposed group opted for an induced abortion; in the unexposed group, 10 patients (12.5%) had a spontaneous abortion. No pregnancy/delivery complications were reported for the remaining cases, who successfully completed their pregnancy, with the exception of 1 fetus with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). No significant difference in DFS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-2.42) was observed between young patients with a pregnancy (n = 85) and young patients without a pregnancy (n = 1307).

This epidemiological analysis identifies risk factors for the incidence of CIPN. Methods: This retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare data examined predictors of incident CIPN claims among 11,149 women aged 66 years or older with American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage II to IV breast cancer (and no secondary cancer diagnosis or preexisting neuropathy) who received chemotherapy. Results: Overall, new CIPN claims occurred for 8.3% of patients within 1 year of starting chemotherapy. Risk emerged approximately 3 months after the start of chemotherapy and increased throughout 1 year. Paclitaxel as part of first-line therapy increased CIPN risk 2.7-fold in comparison with nonneurotoxic agents (15.9% vs 5.0%), with lower incidence rates for carboplatin and paclitaxel (11.9%), carboplatin and docetaxel (9.3%), carboplatin alone (7.7%), and docetaxel alone (6.6%). The CIPN incidence rate was higher for women who at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis were relatively young (within this Medicare sample), were at AJCC stage II or III, were married or had an equivalent status, and had fewer comorbidities, but it did not differ by race/ethnicity or poverty level. Conclusions: These Medicare claims database findings indicate that women aged 66 years or older with breast cancer are susceptible to CIPN from taxane and/or platinum compounds, with risk emerging approximately 3 months into treatment. Prospective studies of symptom emergence and clinical response (eg, stopping chemotherapy and adjunctive treatments) are indicated to determine how best to inform patients of this risk and to manage CIPN in this population. © 2018 American Cancer Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85055952906

In order to counsel these patients as to their prognosis, we investigated the association between metastatic free interval (MFI) and subsequent survival from newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in a population-level U.S. cohort. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database was used to identify patients with both an initial stage 1–3 breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent MBC diagnosis recorded from 1988 to 2014. Patients were stratified by MFI (< 5 years, 5–10 years, > 10 years). The association between MFI and metastatic breast cancer-specific mortality (MBCSM) was analyzed with Fine–Gray competing risks regression. Results: Five-year recurrent metastatic breast cancer-specific survival rate was 23%, 26%, and 35% for patients with MFI < 5, 5–10, and > 10 years, respectively. Patients with > 10 year MFI were less likely to die of breast cancer when compared with a referent group with < 5 years MFI (standard hazard ratio (SHR) 0.77 [95% CI 0.65–0.90] P < 0.001). There was no significant difference for patients with MFI of 5–10 years (SHR 0.92 [95% CI 0.81–1.04, P 0.191]) compared to < 5 years. Other prognostic factors like White race, lower tumor grade, and ER/PR-positive receptors were also associated with improved cancer-specific survival after diagnosis of MBC. Conclusion: Prolonged MFI greater than 10 years between initial breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent metastatic disease was found to be associated with improved recurrent MBC 5-year survival and decreased risk of breast cancer-specific mortality. This has potential implications for counseling patients as to prognosis, choice of treatment, as well as the stratification of patients considered for MBC clinical trials. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054133533

Two years of trastuzumab does not improve efficacy but increases cost, inconvenience, and adverse effects. We aimed to evaluate if less than 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab retained efficacy while reducing toxicities and cost. Methods: We performed a pooled analyses of efficacy and toxicity from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing 1 year of trastuzumab to shorter durations in adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Hazard Ratios (HR) for Overall Survival (OS) and Disease-Free Survival (DFS), and Odds Ratios (OR) for cardiac events with respective 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were weighted using generic inverse variance approach and pooled in meta-analyses using random effects models with RevMan 5.3 software. Sub-group analyses of outcomes based on Estrogen Receptor (ER) and nodal status were performed. Results: Five RCTs involving approximately 12,000 patients qualified—three assessing 6 months and two assessing 9 weeks of trastuzumab compared to 1 year. All RCTs were designed to test non-inferiority of the shorter treatment. One year of trastuzumab resulted into better OS (pooled HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07–1.42) and DFS (pooled HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09–1.36) in overall population, but the benefit of longer treatment was statistically insignificant in node negative (HR 1. 20, p = 0.11), and ER positive disease (HR 1.15, p = 0.09).

TransNEOS, a translational study of New Primary Endocrine-therapy Origination Study (NEOS), evaluated whether Recurrence Score results can predict clinical response to neoadjuvant letrozole. Methods: NEOS is a phase 3 clinical trial of hormonal therapy ± adjuvant chemotherapy for postmenopausal patients with ER+, HER2-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer, after six months of neoadjuvant letrozole and breast surgery. TransNEOS patients had tumors ≥ 2 cm and archived core-biopsy samples taken before neoadjuvant letrozole and subsequently sent for Recurrence Score testing. The primary endpoint was to evaluate clinical (complete or partial) response to neoadjuvant letrozole for RS < 18 versus RS ≥ 31. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of clinical response and rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) by continuous Recurrence Score result, ESR1 and PGR single-gene scores, and ER gene-group score. Results: Of 295 TransNEOS patients (median age 63 years; median tumor size 25 mm; 66% grade 1), 53.2% had RS < 18, 28.5% had RS18–30, and 18.3% had RS ≥ 31. Clinical response rates were 54% (RS < 18), 42% (RS18–30), and 22% (RS ≥ 31). A higher proportion of patients with RS < 18 had clinical responses (p < 0.001 vs. RS ≥ 31). In multivariable analyses, continuous Recurrence Score result (p < 0.001), ESR1 score (p = 0.049), PGR score (p < 0.001), and ER gene-group score (p < 0.001) were associated with clinical response.

Patients with a prior history of breast cancer or atypia were excluded. Results: A total of 4775 patients were deemed eligible. Median age was 40 (range 13–86) and was higher in patients with any incidental finding compared to patients with normal reports (52 vs. 39 years, p = 0.0001).

We evaluated upgrade rates and factors associated with upgrade to malignancy following a core biopsy diagnosis of NC-LCIS, and its natural history. Methods: Upon Institutional Review Board approval, pathology databases were searched for NC-LCIS core biopsy diagnoses (carcinoma in situ [CIS], CIS with ductal and lobular features [CIS/DLF], pleomorphic LCIS [P-LCIS], variant LCIS [V-LCIS], LCIS with necrosis). Cases with available core and excision pathology were included, while cases with concurrent ipsilateral invasive carcinoma (IC), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and/or atypical ductal hyperplasia were excluded. Results: Overall, 121 NC-LCIS cases were identified from 1998 to 2017. We excluded 46 cases with concurrent cancer; 75 patients with 76 NC-LCIS core biopsy diagnoses followed by excision formed our study cohort. Median age was 56 years (range 41–83), and all imaging findings were classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4; calcifications were the most common biopsy indication (80%). Excision yielded malignancy in 27 (36%) patients (IC 17, 63%; DCIS alone 10, 37%). We were unable to identify radiologic or pathologic features predictive of upgrade. Of 49 pure NC-LCIS cases, 15 (31%) had mastectomy, 9 (18%) had excision and radiation, and 25 (51%) had excision alone. At a median follow-up of 58 months (range 1–224), 1/25 (4%) patients with excision alone developed ipsilateral DCIS 14 months later. Conclusions: In this series of NC-LCIS, 36% of cases were upgraded, supporting routine excision. We were unable to identify predictors of upgrade. Among 25 patients with pure NC-LCIS, only one patient developed a future ipsilateral cancer. Further study of the natural history of NC-LCIS is warranted. © 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055880466

The benefit from neratinib appeared to be greater in patients with ER þ /HER2 þ tumors. We thus sought to discover mechanisms that may explain the benefit from extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib. Experimental Design: Mice with established ER þ /HER2 þ MDA-MB-361 tumors were treated with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab pertuzumab for 4 weeks, and then randomized to fulvestrant neratinib treatment. The benefit from neratinib was evaluated by performing gene expression analysis for 196 ER targets, ER transcriptional reporter assays, and cell-cycle analyses. Results: Mice receiving ""extended adjuvant"" therapy with fulvestrant/neratinib maintained a complete response, whereas those treated with fulvestrant relapsed rapidly. In three ER þ / HER2 þ cell lines (MDA-MB-361, BT-474, UACC-893) but not in ER þ /HER2 MCF7 cells, treatment with neratinib induced ER reporter transcriptional activity, whereas treatment with fulvestrant resulted in increased HER2 and EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting compensatory reciprocal crosstalk between the ER and ERBB RTK pathways. ER transcriptional reporter assays, gene expression, and immunoblot analyses showed that treatment with neratinib/fulvestrant, but not fulvestrant, potently inhibited growth and downregulated ER reporter activity, P-AKT, P-ERK, and cyclin D1 levels. Finally, similar to neratinib, genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of cyclin D1 enhanced fulvestrant action against ER þ /HER2 þ breast cancer cells. Conclusions: These data suggest that ER blockade leads to reactivation of ERBB RTKs and thus extended ERBB blockade is necessary to achieve durable clinical outcomes in patients with ER þ /HER2 þ breast cancer. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85060052933

This study aims to characterize a novel PALB2 synonymous variant c.18G>T (p.Gly6=) identified in a family with pancreatic and breast cancers. Methods: The PALB2 c.18G>T (p.Gly6=) variant in this family was identified using Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT™). RT-PCR and subsequent cloning were performed to investigate whether this variant affects normal splicing. Results: This variant completely disrupts normal splicing and leads to several abnormal transcripts, which presumably leads to premature protein truncation. The major abnormal transcript resulted in a deletion of 32 base pairs in exon 1 and frameshift. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the PALB2 c.18G>T (p.Gly6=) variant is likely pathogenic.

This study examined the association between regional market competition and use of breast reconstruction for women with breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing mastectomy. Methods: Women who underwent mastectomy from 2010 to 2011 recorded in the National Inpatient Sample were selected. The competitive market environment for each hospital in which patients were treated was estimated using the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index. Multivariable models were developed to examine the association between regional market competition and breast reconstruction, with adjustment for other clinical, demographic, and structural variables. Results: Immediate breast reconstruction was performed for 9902 (45%) of 22,011 women. The rate of immediate breast reconstruction was 34.5% at hospitals in non-competitive markets, 49% at hospitals in moderately competitive markets, and 56.4% at hospitals in highly competitive markets (P < 0.0001). In a multivariable model, women in moderately competitive markets were 24% (risk ratio [RR] 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.41) more likely to undergo immediate breast reconstruction than women in noncompetitive markets, whereas those in competitive markets were 25% (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.11–1.41) more likely to have reconstruction. Later year of treatment, higher census tract income level, and residence in an urban area were associated with an increased likelihood of reconstruction (P < 0.05 for all). In contrast, older age, non-white race, and non-commercial insurance were associated with a lower likelihood of reconstruction (P < 0.05 for all).

However, it is unknown whether it may also be linked with increased risk of benign breast disease (BBD). Methods: Our study leveraged 61,907 women aged 17–55 years old from the Project ELEFANT study. BBD was diagnosed by clinician. Self-reported data on psychosocial stress over a 10-year period was retrospectively collected from questionnaires and categorised by cause (work, social and economic) and severity (none, low and high). Odd ratios (ORs) for the development of BBD were estimated using logistic regression. The model was adjusted for age, BMI, TSH levels, smoking, alcohol consumption, family history, age of menarche, oral contraceptive usage, education and occupation. Results: Within our study, 8% (4,914) of participants were diagnosed with BBD. Work-related stress [OR 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46–1.69] and financial stress (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.24–1.44) were significantly associated with BBD incidence, with a smaller but still significant association with social stress (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.21). The associations remained significant after exclusion of participants with first- and second-degree family history of breast disease. The presence of multiple forms of stress did not synergistically increase risk. The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of systemic inflammation and prognostic marker for breast cancer, was not associated with BBD. Conclusions: Psychosocial stress, particularly work-related and financial stress, is associated with increased risk of benign breast disease among young Chinese women. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053890032

We examined whether use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of adjuvant chemotherapy varies by nonclinical factors such as patient socioeconomic status or rural residence. Methods: Women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013–2014 at eight medical institutions were surveyed by mail regarding their experiences with breast cancer treatment, and this information was linked to hospital-based cancer registries. We examined the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy among women with histologically confirmed invasive stage I–III breast cancer and used regression models to examine the association of socioeconomic status with chemotherapy timing. We also explored potential mechanisms for those differences. Results: Over 29% of the chemotherapy sample overall received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant receipt was lower for those with income < $100,000 (AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.2–0.9) even with adjustment for other demographics, stage, and biomarker status, and findings for education and a variable for both lowest education and income < $100,000 were similar. Rural/urban residence was not associated with neoadjuvant receipt. Differences by income in perceptions of the importance of neoadjuvant chemotherapy advantages and disadvantages did not appear to explain the differences in use by income. Conclusions: In a multicenter sample of breast cancer patients, lower income was strongly associated with less receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Since patients with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to present with later-stage disease, this pattern has the potential to contribute to breast cancer outcome disparities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053679946

There is no benefit from chemotherapy among patients aged ≥50 years who have lymph node-negative disease and an RS from 11 to 25, but the benefit of chemotherapy in the lymph node-positive group remains unknown. Methods: On the basis of data from the National Cancer Data Base between 2010 and 2014, a nationwide, retrospective cohort study included 73,185 women who had stage I through IIIA breast cancer and an RS between 11 and 30. Results: Receipt of chemotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of death among patients who had lymph node-positive breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.74; P <.001) after adjusting for other prognostic factors in a multivariable Cox model. The 5-year survival gain ranged from 1.3% (RS 11-17 subgroup), to 3.3% (RS 18-25 subgroup), and to 6.7% (RS 26-30 subgroup). Among patients who had lymph node-negative disease, chemotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of death for those with an RS from 25 to 30 (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.96; P =.03; 5-year survival gain, 1.8%), but there was no benefit from chemotherapy for patients who had an RS from 11 to 17 (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.61-1.55; P =.90), and there was a marginally significant benefit for women who had an RS from 18 to 25 (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.00; P =.05). Similar results were observed using propensity score-matching method. Conclusions: The benefit of chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer who have an intermediate RS is driven in a nonlinear fashion by RS: the higher the RS, the larger the absolute benefit.

In this study, we sought to reduce opioid prescribing after breast and melanoma procedures by designing and implementing an intervention focused on education and prescribing guidelines, and then evaluating the impact of this intervention. Methods: In this single-institution study, we designed and implemented an intervention targeting key factors identified in qualitative interviews. This included mandatory education for prescribers, evidence-based prescribing guidelines, and standardized patient instructions. After the intervention, interrupted time-series analysis was used to compare the mean quantity of opioid prescribed before and after the intervention (July 2016–September 2017). We also evaluated the frequency of opioid prescription refills. Results: During the study, 847 patients underwent breast or melanoma procedures and received an opioid prescription. For mastectomy or wide local excision for melanoma, the mean quantity of opioid prescribed immediately decreased by 37% after the intervention (p = 0.03), equivalent to 13 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg. For lumpectomy or breast biopsy, the mean quantity of opioid prescribed decreased by 42%, or 12 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg (p = 0.07). Furthermore, opioid prescription refills did not significantly change for mastectomy/wide local excision (13% vs. 14%, p = 0.8), or lumpectomy/breast biopsy (4% vs. 5%, p = 0.7). Conclusion: Education and prescribing guidelines reduced opioid prescribing for breast and melanoma procedures without increasing the need for refills.

MHV hotspots for bleeding can be anticipated when applying the previously developed MHV Roadmap to a minimally invasive approach.1 This video demonstrates application of the MHV Roadmap to perform a safe laparoscopic right hepatectomy. Patient: A 44-year-old woman with a solitary and large breast cancer liver metastasis in the right liver was considered for a laparoscopic right hepatectomy following an excellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The MHV anatomy was reconstructed using automated vascular reconstruction software (Synapse, Fuji) ahead of surgery. Technique: With the patient in the French position, the hilar vessels are exposed and the inflow is controlled. Parenchymal transection begins along the demarcation line.2 , 3 The constant relationship between the portal bifurcation and the V5 ventral and dorsal allows for easy intraparenchymal identification of the MHV. The parenchymal transection is performed in a convex fashion to optimize exposure of the MHV. Using MHV guidance, the parenchymal transection is continued and V8 is safely identified. The operation is completed with division of the anterior fissure and right hepatic vein. Conclusion: Outlining the MHV anatomy according to the MHV Roadmap preoperatively helps to anticipate hotspots of bleeding. Guidance along the MHV through the parenchymal transection allows for early identification of tributaries, thereby preventing injury and remnant liver ischemia. © 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85057079756

Methods: We extracted demographics and clinical data from the SEER-18 registry for adult patients with MGs. The cases were separated based on the sequence of MG diagnosis relative to the other primary tumors: Group (A) One primary only or first primary of multiple primaries and Group (B) second primary or subsequent primary tumor. Incidences, frequencies, and glioma-related survivals were analyzed. Results: Group B constituted 12.8% of new MG. The incidences of group B, relative to those of all new MG, range from 0.14 to 0.18. Compared to group A, group B exhibited an older age. Moreover, group B exhibited a higher proportion of females, Caucasians, smaller tumors, non-operative cases, and those receiving radiation (p < 0.05); the proportion with GTR remained comparable. Multiple groupings (oral cavity, digestive system, respiratory system, skin, breast, genital systems, urinary system, lymphoma) exhibited lower glioma-related observed survival (p < 0.05) compared to Group A. An active diagnosis of “leukemia” appears to confer longer glioma-related survival while a history of “breast” or “digestive system” malignancies portends a shorter glioma-related survival. Conclusion: For newly diagnosed MG, a high proportion does have history of extra-CNS primary tumors. Generally, these patients appear to have worse glioma-related observed survival compare to those with malignant glioma as the only primary or the first of multiple primary tumors.

For the analysis of the treatment comparison from such a trial, in 1999, the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test was proposed, which was a generalization of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test based on pairwise comparison of patients on a primary outcome when possible but otherwise on a secondary outcome. In 2012, Pocock and colleagues suggested an estimate based on this concept, the Win Ratio, which summarized the ratio of the number of patients who fared better versus worse on the experimental arm. However, in 2016, Oakes noted that the Win Ratio could be a function of the distribution of follow-up times of the trial. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach to representing the Win Ratio graphically in such a way that the effect of time on the estimate would be apparent. In addition, the methods are used to display the contribution of each endpoint to the composite. We apply the methods to clinical trials in cancer, cardiology, and neurology.

We have previously performed breast cancer GWAS in Latinas and identified a strongly protective single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at 6q25, with the protective minor allele originating from indigenous American ancestry. Here we report on fine mapping of the 6q25 locus in an expanded sample of Latinas. Methods: We performed GWAS in 2385 cases and 6416 controls who were either US Latinas or Mexican women. We replicated the top SNPs in 2412 cases and 1620 controls of US Latina, Mexican, and Colombian women. In addition, we validated the top novel variants in studies of African, Asian and European ancestry. In each dataset we used logistic regression models to test the association between SNPs and breast cancer risk and corrected for genetic ancestry using either principal components or genetic ancestry inferred from ancestry informative markers using a model-based approach. Results: We identified a novel set of SNPs at the 6q25 locus associated with genome-wide levels of significance (p = 3.3 × 10 - 8 - 6.0 × 10 - 9 ) not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with variants previously reported at this locus. These SNPs were in high LD (r 2 &gt; 0.9) with each other, with the top SNP, rs3778609, associated with breast cancer with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.76 (0.70-0.84). In a replication in women of Latin American origin, we also observed a consistent effect (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78-0.99; p = 0.037). We also performed a meta-analysis of these SNPs in East Asians, African ancestry and European ancestry populations and also observed a consistent effect (rs3778609, OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.97; p = 0.0017). Conclusion: Our study adds to evidence about the importance of the 6q25 locus for breast cancer susceptibility. Our finding also highlights the utility of performing additional searches for genetic variants for breast cancer in non-European populations. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",,2-s2.0-85059952983

Expression of MDM2 and MDMX occurs in estrogen receptor α-positive (ERα + ) breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There are p53-independent influences of MDM2 and MDMX, and 80% of TNBC express mutant p53 (mtp53). MDM2 drives TNBC circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in mice, but the context-dependent influences of MDM2 and MDMX on different subtypes of breast cancers expressing mtp53 have not been determined. Methods: To assess the context-dependent roles, we carried out MDM2 and MDMX knockdown in orthotopic tumors of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells expressing mtp53 R280K and MDM2 knockdown in ERα + T47D cells expressing mtp53 L194F. The corresponding cell proliferation was scored in vitro by growth curves and in vivo by orthotopic tumor volumes. Cell migration was assessed in vitro by wound-healing assays and cell intravasation in vivo by sorting GFP-positive CTCs by flow cytometry. The metastasis gene targets were determined by an RT-PCR array card screen and verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Results: Knocking down MDMX or MDM2 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced cell migration and CTC detection, but only MDMX knockdown reduced tumor volumes at early time points. This is the first report of MDMX overexpression in TNBC enhancing the CTC phenotype with correlated upregulation of CXCR4. Experiments were carried out to compare MDM2-knockdown outcomes in nonmetastatic ERα + T47D cells. The knockdown of MDM2 in ERα + T47D orthotopic tumors decreased primary tumor volumes, supporting our previous finding that estrogen-activated MDM2 increases cell proliferation. Conclusions: This is the first report showing that the expression of MDM2 in ERα + breast cancer and TNBC can result in different tumor-promoting outcomes. Both MDMX and MDM2 overexpression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced the CTC phenotype. These data indicate that both MDM2 and MDMX can promote TNBC metastasis and that it is important to consider the context-dependent roles of MDM2 family members in different subtypes of breast cancer. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",,2-s2.0-85059946619

We aimed to estimate the CAP incidence rate, mortality, and healthcare-related costs of CAP patients with different cancer subtypes in Germany. Methods: We used German health claims data of a representative sample of 4 million subjects to conduct cohort studies in patients with a new diagnosis of lung, hematological, breast, gastro-intestinal tract and renal/urinary-tract cancer and a comparator cohort without cancer between 2011 and 2015. CAP cases were identified in both the hospital and ambulatory care setting. Crude and age- and sex-standardized incidence rates (sIR) of CAP and mortality after CAP were calculated. To compare the health care-related costs of cancer patients with and without a diagnosis of CAP, a propensity-score (PS) matched control group was created. Results: The study population comprised of 89,007 patients with cancer. In lung cancer patients, the sIR was increased 21-fold compared to the control cohort. For the other cancer subtypes, the sIR was increased 4.3-fold (hematological malignancies) to 1.7-fold (breast cancer) compared to the control cohort. The 30-day mortality in CAP cases was highest in lung cancer patients with 20.0% and ranged from 7.2 to 18.5% in CAP cases with other cancer subtypes. The highest costs were observed in CAP cases with hematological malignancies with 28,969 € (SD 37,142 €) and the lowest in patients with renal/urinary tract cancer with 17,432 € (SD 19,579 €). The absolute difference in the mean overall costs between CAP cases and controls without CAP ranged from 4,111€ to 9,826€, depending on the cancer type. CAP-related costs were predominantly triggered by substantially elevated hospital costs in CAP cases. Conclusions: The incidence rate of CAP and related mortality is high in patients with cancer with strong variations by cancer subtype. Furthermore, CAP in cancer patients is associated with substantial direct excess costs. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059951671

Background: Oncology patients with severe AS are often denied valve replacement. TAVR may be an emerging treatment option. Methods: A worldwide registry was designed to collect data on patients who undergo TAVR while having active malignancy. Data from 222 cancer patients from 18 TAVR centers were compared versus 2,522 “no-cancer” patients from 5 participating centers. Propensity-score matching was performed to further adjust for bias. Results: Cancer patients’ age was 78.8 ± 7.5 years, STS score 4.9 ± 3.4%, 62% men. Most frequent cancers were gastrointestinal (22%), prostate (16%), breast (15%), hematologic (15%), and lung (11%). At the time of TAVR, 40% had stage 4 cancer. Periprocedural complications were comparable between the groups. Although 30-day mortality was similar, 1-year mortality was higher in cancer patients (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001); one-half of the deaths were due to neoplasm. Among patients who survived 1 year after the TAVR, one-third were in remission/cured from cancer. Progressive malignancy (stage III to IV) was a strong mortality predictor (hazard ratio: 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.74 to 3.23; p < 0.001), whereas stage I to II cancer was not associated with higher mortality compared with no-cancer patients. Conclusions: TAVR in cancer patients is associated with similar short-term but worse long-term prognosis compared with patients without cancer. Among this cohort, mortality is largely driven by cancer, and progressive malignancy is a strong mortality predictor. Importantly, 85% of the patients were alive at 1 year, one-third were in remission/cured from cancer.

To facilitate identification of patients at risk for HCS, Counsyl developed a digital identification tool (digital ID tool) to match personal and family cancer history to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) BRCA-related Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC), Lynch syndrome, and polyposis testing criteria in one-to-one, automated fashion. The purpose of this study was to validate the ability of the digital ID tool to accurately identify histories that do and do not meet NCCN testing criteria. Methods: Third-party recorded three-generation pedigrees were retrospectively reviewed by a certified genetic counselor (CGC) to determine if independent events included in pedigree histories met NCCN guidelines, and were then sorted into groups: high risk events (meets criteria) and low risk events (does not meet criteria). Events were entered into the digital ID tool to determine the extent of its concordance with events sorted by CGC review. Statistical tests of accuracy were calculated at a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: One hundred ninety-seven pedigrees were reviewed consecutively representing 765 independent events for analysis across groups. 382/382 (100%) high risk events identified by the digital ID tool and 381/383 (99.47%) low risk events identified by the digital ID tool were concordant with CGC sorting. The digital ID tool had a sensitivity of 100% (99.04-100% CI) and specificity of 99.48% (98.13-99.94% CI). The overall accuracy of the digital ID tool was estimated to be 99.74% (99.06-99.97% CI), reflecting the rate at which the digital ID tool reached the same conclusion as that of CGC review of pedigree events for the recommendation of genetic testing for individuals at risk for HCS. Conclusions: The digital ID tool accurately matches NCCN criteria in one-to-one fashion to identify at-risk individuals for HCS and may be useful in clinical practice, specifically for BRCA-related HBOC and Lynch Syndrome. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059869892

We analyzed long-term follow-up (LTFU) of efficacy outcomes and adverse events in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study reported after a median follow-up of 12.6 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BIG 1-98 is a four-arm, phase III, double-blind, randomized trial comparing adjuvant letrozole versus tamoxifen (either treatment received for 5 years) and their sequences (2 years of one treatment plus 3 years of the other) for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer. When pharmaceutical company sponsorship ended at 8.4 years of median follow-up, academic partners initiated an observational, LTFU extension collecting annual data on survival, disease status, and adverse events. Information from Denmark was from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Registry. Intention-to-treat analyses are reported. RESULTS: Of 8,010 enrolled patients, 4,433 were alive and not withdrawn at an LTFU participating center, and 3,833 (86%) had at least one LTFU report. For the monotherapy comparison of letrozole versus tamoxifen, we found a 9% relative reduction in the hazard of a disease-free survival event with letrozole (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.01). HRs for other efficacy end points were similar to those for disease-free survival. Efficacy of letrozole versus tamoxifen for contralateral breast cancer varied significantly over time (0- to 5-, 5- to 10-, and . 10-year HRs, 0.62, 0.47, and 1.35, respectively; treatment-by-time interaction P = .005), perhaps reflecting a longer carryover effect of tamoxifen. Reporting of specific long-term adverse events seemed more effective with national registry than with case-record reporting of clinical follow-up. CONCLUSION: Efficacy end points continued to show trends favoring letrozole. Letrozole reduced contralateral breast cancer frequency in the first 10 years, but this reversed beyond 10 years.

These polymers were synthesized via solvent- and catalyst-free nucleophilic addition between PEG-diamine and vitamin E-functionalized cyclic carbonate. The catalyst-free synthesis enabled an easy purification step and recycling of excess monomers. The polymers formed hydrogels through self-assembly by simply dissolving in aqueous solution. The hydrogel stiffness was easily tuned by varying polymer concentration, PEG molecular weight and number of vitamin E molecules. The triblock copolymer with one vitamin E molecule on each end of PEG (20 kDa) formed hydrogel at a concentration of 4.0 wt% and above. The hydrogel showed pronounced shear-thinning behavior, and was injectable. Particularly, the hydrogel formed with carbamate block junction was stiffer than that with carbonate block junction, and provided more sustained antibody release.

A combination of constrained public revenues with rapid technological and clinical change has created a particularly demanding set of operational challenges. Tax-funded health systems face three ongoing struggles: 1) finding badly needed new public revenues despite inadequate GDP growth 2) channeling additional funds into new high-quality provider capacity 3) re-configuring the stasis-tied organizational structure and operations of existing public providers. This commentary reviews key elements of this new information-revolution-driven context, followed by a consideration of seven specific policy challenges that it creates and/or worsens for tax-funded European systems going forward. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059797750

The clinicopathological features, treatment patterns and prognosis of SCC of the breast is still unclear. Methods: In this study, we performed a 1:4 SCC-IDC (infiltrating ductal carcinoma) matching analysis of patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2014, using the data from the national cancer database. We used Chi-square test to compare the clinicopathological features and treatment patterns between SCC (n = 686) and IDC (n = 2744) patients. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox-regression to estimate the survival of SCC and IDC patients. Results: We observed that SCC patients are more likely to have T3-4, grade III, and ER negative diseases, when compared to IDC patients. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) (58.3% vs 65.4%, p = 0.048), as well as radiotherapy after BCS (65.3% vs. 83.0%, p < 0.001), was less performed in SCC patients. Among low-risk patients, chemotherapy was used more often for SCC patients (42.9%) than for IDC (18.7%) patients (p = 0.002). In HR-positive patients, endocrine therapy was used less often for SCC patients (51.6%) than for IDC patients (70.5%) (p < 0.001). SCC (vs. IDC) was associated with no responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (20% vs. 5.05%, p = 0.019). Adjusted analysis confirmed that SCC (vs. IDC) was associated with worse OS (HR = 1.40, 95%CI 1.17-1.67, P < 0.01), after a median follow-up of 58.3 months. In SCC patients, HR status is not prognostic of OS, but endocrine therapy was significantly associated with improved OS in HR-positive SCC patients. Conclusions: We conclude that SCC is associated with poorer clinicopathological features, no responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and worse clinical outcomes than IDC. The treatment patterns for SCC and IDC are different. Endocrine therapy is necessary for HR-positive SCC patients. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059795107

Their clinical potential in immunotherapy against metastatic cancers is being evaluated across a number of clinical trials. TLR9 agonists are DNA-based molecules that contain several non-methylated CG-motifs for TLR9 recognition. Chemical modifications of DNA backbones are usually employed to prevent degradation by nucleases. These, however, can promote undesirable off-target effects and therapeutic restrictions. Methods: Within the EnanDIM® family members of TLR9 agonists described here, D-deoxyribose nucleotides at the nuclease-accessible 3′-ends are replaced by nuclease-resistant L-deoxyribose nucleotides. EnanDIM® molecules with varying sequences were screened for their activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells based on secretion of IFN-alpha and IP-10 as well as activation of immune cells. Selected molecules were evaluated in mice in a maximum feasible dose study and for analysis of immune activation. The ability to modulate the tumor-microenvironment and anti-tumor responses after EnanDIM® administration was analyzed in syngeneic murine tumor models. Results: The presence of L-deoxyribose containing nucleotides at their 3′-ends is sufficient to prevent EnanDIM® molecules from nucleolytic degradation. EnanDIM® molecules show broad immune activation targeting specific components of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Activation was strictly dependent on the presence of CG-motifs, known to be recognized by TLR9. The absence of off-target effects may enable a wide therapeutic window. This advantageous anti-tumoral immune profile also promotes increased T cell infiltration into CT26 colon carcinoma tumors, which translates into reduced tumor growth. EnanDIM® molecules also drove regression of multiple other murine syngeneic tumors including MC38 colon carcinoma, B16 melanoma, A20 lymphoma, and EMT-6 breast cancer. In A20 and EMT-6, EnanDIM® immunotherapy cured a majority of mice and established persistent anti-tumor immune memory as evidenced by the complete immunity of these mice to subsequent tumor re-challenge. Conclusions: In summary, EnanDIM® comprise a novel family of TLR9 agonists that facilitate an efficacious activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Their proven potential in onco-immunotherapy, as shown by cytotoxic activity, beneficial modulation of the tumor microenvironment, inhibition of tumor growth, and induction of long-lasting, tumor-specific memory, supports EnanDIM® molecules for further preclinical and clinical development. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059735517

Breast cancers (BCs) with HER2 IHC-negative (IHC-) and ISH-amplified (ISH+) results have been rarely reported but not well studied. We investigated the frequency of HER2 IHC-/ISH+ BCs and their response to anti-HER2 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods Seventeen BCs with HER2 IHC-/ISH+ results were identified from 1,107 consecutive invasive BCs (1.5%, 17/1,107). Results Gene protein assay confirmed the original HER2 IHC and ISH results. Increased HER2 RNA level was detected in HER2 IHC-/ISH+ cases compared with HER2 IHC-/ISH- cases. Eight patients had anti-HER2 NAC; three had pathologic complete response, and five had residual tumors. Conclusions A small percentage of patients (1.5%) showed discordant HER2 IHC and ISH results (IHC-/ISH+) and would have lost the opportunity for potentially beneficial anti-HER2-targeted therapy if only HER2 IHC testing had been used. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2018.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059234582

We have been exploring the use of single domain antibody fragments (sdAbs) labeled with 18 F using residualizing prosthetic agents for this purpose. In this study, we have labeled two sdAbs that bind to different domains on the HER2 receptor, 2Rs15d and 5F7, using 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl 6-[ 18 F]fluoronicotinate ([ 18 F]TFPFN) and evaluated their HER2 targeting properties in vitro and in vivo. The overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield for the synthesis of [ 18 F]TFPFN-2Rs15d and [ 18 F]TFPFN-5F7 was 5.7 ± 3.6 and 4.0 ± 2.0%, respectively. The radiochemical purity of labeled sdAbs was &gt;95%, immunoreactive fractions were about 60%, and affinity was in the low nanomolar range. Intracellularly trapped activity from [ 18 F]TFPFN-2Rs15d and [ 18 F]TFPFN-5F7 in HER2-expressing SKOV-3 ovarian and BT474M1 breast carcinoma cells were similar to the sdAbs labeled using the previously validated radioiodination residualizing prosthetic agents N-succinimidyl 4-guanidinomethyl-3-[ 125 I]iodobenzoate ([ 125 I]SGMIB) and N-succinimidyl 3-guanidinomethyl-5-[ 125 I]iodobenzoate (iso-[ 125 I]SGMIB). Intracellular activity was about 2-fold higher for radiolabeled 5F7 compared with 2Rs15d for both 18 F and 125 I. While tumor uptake of both [ 18 F]TFPFN-2Rs15d and [ 18 F]TFPFN-5F7 was comparable to those for the coadministered 125 I-labeled sdAb, renal uptake of the 18 F-labeled sdAbs was substantially lower. In microPET images, the tumor was clearly delineated in SKOV-3 and BT474 xenograft-bearing athymic mice with low levels of background activity in normal tissues, except the bladder. These results indicate that the [ 18 F]TFPFN prosthetic group could be a valuable reagent for developing sdAb-based immunoPET imaging agents. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","Final",,2-s2.0-85058084457

Normally, 35% of breast cancer is Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2 (ERBB2)-positive that predisposes to poor prognosis and relapse, while ethanol drinking leads to invasion of their ERBB2 positive cells triggering the phosphorylation status of mitogen-activated protein kinase. StAR-related lipid transfer protein 10 (STARD10) is a lipid transporter of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); changes on membrane composition of PC and PE occur before the morphological tumorigenic events. Interestingly, STARD10 has been described to be highly expressed in 35-40% of ERBB2-positive breast cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that ethanol administration promotes STARD10 and ERBB2 expression that is significantly associated with increased cell malignancy and aggressiveness. Material and methods: We investigated the effect of ethanol on STARD10-ERBB2 cross-talk in breast cancer cells, MMTV-neu transgenic mice and in clinical ERBB2-positive breast cancer specimens with Western Blotting and Real-time PCR. We also examined the effects of their knockdown and overexpression on transient transfected breast cancer cells using promoter activity, MTT, cell migration, calcium and membrane fluidity assays in vitro. Results: Ethanol administration induces STARD10 and ERBB2 expression in vitro and in vivo. ERBB2 overexpression causes an increase in STARD10 expression, while overexpression of ERBB2's downstream targets, p65, c-MYC, c-FOS or c-JUN induces STARD10 promoter activity, correlative of enhanced ERBB2 function. Ethanol and STARD10-mediated cellular membrane fluidity and intracellular calcium concentration impact ERBB2 signaling pathway as evaluated by enhanced p65 nuclear translocation and binding to both ERBB2 and STARD10 promoters. Conclusion: Our finding proved that STARD10 and ERBB2 positively regulate each other's expression and function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ethanol can modulate ERBB2's function in breast cancer via a novel interplay with STARD10. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059496068

Breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy often experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite that potentially affect body weight and body composition. Changes in body weight and body composition may detrimentally affect their quality of life, and could potentially increase the risk of disease recurrence, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. To date, from existing single method (quantitative or qualitative) studies is not clear whether changes in body weight and body composition in breast cancer patients are treatment related because previous studies have not included a control group of women without breast cancer. Methods: We therefore developed the COBRA-study (Change Of Body composition in BReast cancer: All-in Assessment-study) to assess changes in body weight, body composition and related lifestyle factors such as changes in physical activity, dietary intake and other behaviours. Important and unique features of the COBRA-study is that it used I) a ""Mixed Methods Design"", in order to quantitatively assess changes in body weight, body composition and lifestyle factors and, to qualitatively assess how perceptions of women may have influenced these measured changes pre-, during and post-chemotherapy, and II) a control group of non-cancer women for comparison. Descriptive statistics on individual quantitative data were combined with results from a thematic analysis on the interviews- and focus group data to understand patients' experiences before, during and after chemotherapy. Discussion: The findings of our mixed methods study, on chemotherapy treated cancer patients and a comparison group, can enable healthcare researchers and professionals to develop tailored intervention schemes to help breast cancer patients prevent or handle the physical and mental changes they experience as a result of their chemotherapy. This will ultimately improve their quality of life and could potentially reduce their risk for other co-morbidity health issues such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059495223

of women according to their risk of breast cancer based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) could improve screening and prevention strategies. Our aim was to develop PRSs, optimized for prediction of estrogen receptor (ER)-specific disease, from the largest available genome-wide association dataset and to empirically validate the PRSs in prospective studies. The development dataset comprised 94,075 case subjects and 75,017 control subjects of European ancestry from 69 studies, divided into training and validation sets. Samples were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by stepwise regression or lasso penalized regression. The best performing PRSs were validated in an independent test set comprising 11,428 case subjects and 18,323 control subjects from 10 prospective studies and 190,040 women from UK Biobank (3,215 incident breast cancers). For the best PRSs (313 SNPs), the odds ratio for overall disease per 1 standard deviation in ten prospective studies was 1.61 (95%CI: 1.57–1.65) with area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) = 0.630 (95%CI: 0.628–0.651). The lifetime risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile of the PRSs was 32.6%. Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of risk had 4.37- and 2.78-fold risks, and those in the lowest 1% of risk had 0.16- and 0.27-fold risks, of developing ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that this PRS was well calibrated and predicts disease risk accurately in the tails of the distribution. This PRS is a powerful and reliable predictor of breast cancer risk that may improve breast cancer prevention programs. © 2018 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059498503

Methods: We conducted a nationwide, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with a two-by-two factorial design, of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at a dose of 2000 IU per day and marine n-3 (also called omega-3) fatty acids at a dose of 1 g per day for the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among men 50 years of age or older and women 55 years of age or older in the United States. Primary end points were invasive cancer of any type and major cardiovascular events (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). Secondary end points included site-specific cancers, death from cancer, and additional cardiovascular events. This article reports the results of the comparison of vitamin D with placebo. Results: A total of 25,871 participants, including 5106 black participants, underwent randomization. Supplementation with vitamin D was not associated with a lower risk of either of the primary end points. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years, cancer was diagnosed in 1617 participants (793 in the vitamin D group and 824 in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.06; P = 0.47). A major cardiovascular event occurred in 805 participants (396 in the vitamin D group and 409 in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.12; P = 0.69). In the analyses of secondary end points, the hazard ratios were as follows: for death from cancer (341 deaths), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.02); for breast cancer, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.31); for prostate cancer, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.07); for colorectal cancer, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.62); for the expanded composite end point of major cardiovascular events plus coronary revascularization, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.08); for myocardial infarction, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19); for stroke, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20); and for death from cardiovascular causes, 1.11 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.40). In the analysis of death from any cause (978 deaths), the hazard ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.12). No excess risks of hypercalcemia or other adverse events were identified. Conclusions: Supplementation with vitamin D did not result in a lower incidence of invasive cancer or cardiovascular events than placebo.

The objective of our pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and the efficacy of delivering NCD screening services at home by trained community health workers (CHWs). Men and women aged 30-60 years residing in rural areas of India were targeted for screening. Methods: The CHWs made home visits to educate the participants about healthy lifestyles and symptoms of common cancers and counsel the tobacco/alcohol users to quit. They measured height, weight, blood pressure (BP) and random blood sugar for all and performed oral visual examination (OVE) to screen the tobacco/alcohol users for oral cancer. For cervical cancer screening, the women themselves provided self-collected vaginal samples that the CHWs delivered to the laboratory for high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) detection. The women were not screened for breast cancer but were made aware of the common symptoms and the importance of early diagnosis. Further assessment of the screen-positive individuals and the women with breast symptoms was arranged at the nearest primary health center (PHC). Results: The CHWs screened 1998 men and 4997 women from 20 villages within 6 months; the refusal rate was less than 10%. High BP and sugar were detected in 32.6% and 7.5% participants respectively; hypertension and diabetes were confirmed in 42.3% and 35% respectively among those undergoing follow-up. Obesity prevalence was only 2.4%. More than 50% men were tobacco chewers. Of the total participants, 2.6% were positive on OVE, though no oral cancer was detected among them. HPV test was positive in 8.6% women and they were triaged with visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA) test for treatment either by thermal ablation (same visit) or by loop excision. VIA was positive in 14% of the HPV-positive women and 56.5% of them received same day ablative treatment. The VIA-negative women were advised follow up after 1 year. No breast cancer was detected among the 0.6% women complaining of breast symptoms. Conclusions: Delivery of NCD screening services at home by trained CHWs is feasible and well-accepted by our study population. © 2019 The Author(s).","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059503172

Additionally, radiotherapy can function as in situ cancer vaccination by exposing tumor antigens and providing adjuvants for anti-tumor immune priming. In this regard, the mode of tumor cell death and the repertoire of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are crucial. However, optimal dosing and fractionation of radiotherapy remain controversial. Here, we examined the initial steps of anti-tumor immune priming by different radiation regimens (20 Gy, 4 × 2 Gy, 2 Gy, 0 Gy) with cell lines of triple-negative breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Previously, we have shown that especially high single doses (20 Gy) induce a delayed type of primary necrosis with characteristics of mitotic catastrophe and plasma membrane disintegration. Now, we provide evidence that protein DAMPs released by these dying cells stimulate sequential recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes in vivo. Key players in this regard appear to be endothelial cells revealing a distinct state of activation upon exposure to supernatants of irradiated tumor cells as characterized by high surface expression of adhesion molecules and production of a discrete cytokine/chemokine pattern. Furthermore, irradiated tumor cell-derived protein DAMPs enforced differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells as hallmarked by upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and improved T cell-priming. Consistently, a recurring pattern was observed: The strongest effects were detected with 20 Gy-irradiated cells. Obviously, the initial steps of radiotherapy-induced anti-tumor immune priming are preferentially triggered by high single doses–at least in models of triple-negative breast cancer. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

We previously identified that MAGED4B and FJX1 proteins are overexpressed in HNSCC patients; and further demonstrated that two HLA-A2-restricted 9–11 amino acid peptides derived from these proteins were able to induce anti-tumour immune responses in vitro independently using PBMCs isolated from these patients. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a dual-antigenic peptide vaccine (PV1), comprised of MAGED4B and FJX1 peptides in HNSCC patients. We first demonstrated that 94.8% of HNSCC patients expressed MAGED4B and/or FJX1 by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that PV1 could benefit the majority of HNSCC patients. The presence of pre-existing MAGED4B and FJX1-specific T-cells was detected using a HLA-A2 dimer assay and efficacy of PV1 to induce T-cell to secrete cytotoxic cytokine was evaluated using ELISPOT assay. Pre-existing PV1-specific T-cells were detected in all patients. Notably, we demonstrated that patients’ T-cells were able to secrete cytotoxic cytokines upon exposure to target cells expressing the respective antigen post PV1 stimulation. Furthermore, patients with high expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in their tumours were more responsive to PV1 stimulation, demonstrating the specificity of the PV1 peptide vaccine. Additionally, we also demonstrated the expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in breast, lung, colon, prostate and rectal cancer suggesting the potential use of PV1 in these cancers. In summary, PV1 could be a good vaccine candidate for the treatment of HNSCC patients and other cancers expressing these antigens. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054921629

Approximately 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States are attributable to unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and body fatness. Individual cancers are distinct disease states that are multifactorial in their causation, making them exceedingly cumbersome to study from a nutrition standpoint. Genetic influences are a major piece of the puzzle and personalized nutrition is likely to be most effective in disrupting cancer during all stages. Increasing evidence shows that after a cancer diagnosis, continuing standard dietary recommendations may not be appropriate. This is because powerful dietary interventions such as short-term fasting and carbohydrate restriction can disrupt tumor metabolism, synergizing with standard therapies such as radiation and drug therapy to improve efficacy and ultimately, cancer survival. The importance of identifying dietary interventions cannot be overstated, and the American College of Nutrition’s commitment to advancing knowledge and research is evidenced by dedication of the 2017 ACN Annual Meeting to “Disrupting Cancer: The Role of Personalized Nutrition” and this resulting proceedings manuscript, which summarizes the meeting’s findings. © 2018, © 2018 American College of Nutrition.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85058068663

Psychosocial predictors of adherence and response to CBT-I, such as social support, have not been examined in intervention studies for cancer survivors. Participants: Data from a randomized placebo-controlled 2 x 2 trial of CBT-I and armodafinil (a wakefulness promoting agent) were used to assess adherence. Ninety-six cancer survivors participated in the trial (mean age 56, 86% female, 68% breast cancer). Methods: CBT-I and armodafinil were administered over the course of seven weeks, and participants were assessed at baseline, during intervention, postintervention, and at a three-month follow-up. Social support was assessed using a Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy subscale, insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, and adherence was measured based on CBT-I sleep prescriptions. Results: At baseline, social support was negatively correlated with insomnia severity (r = –0.30, p = 0.002) and associations between social support, CBT-I, and insomnia were maintained through the three-month follow-up. Social support was positively associated with adherence to CBT-I during intervention weeks 3, 4, and 5, and with overall intervention adherence. At postintervention, both social support and treatment with CBT-I independently predicted decreased insomnia severity (p < 0.01) when controlling for baseline insomnia severity. Conclusions: Higher social support is associated with better intervention adherence and improved sleep independent of CBT-I. Additional research is needed to determine whether social support can be leveraged to improve adherence and response to CBT-I. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Final",,2-s2.0-85010700240

However, there are very few published studies describing the evaluation of breast health promotion programs among AI/AN women. Purpose: To describe the formative evaluation of a multicomponent intervention to promote mammography screening in an AI community in rural Oklahoma. Methods: A comprehensive process evaluation plan with emphasis on context, reach, dose received, dose delivered, and fidelity was developed. Data collection included mixed research methodology and impact was assessed via one group pre/post research design. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistical analysis and content analysis. The study utilized a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. Results: Process evaluation revealed a relatively high reach within the priority population for both components (clinic and community) and a moderate implementation. Focus group research showed that participants were overall satisfied with program implementation. The intervention was feasible to implement in real-world settings. Translation to Health Education Practice: Community-based evaluation of breast health promotion programs among AI communities is challenging, because one has to balance methodological rigor with practical constraints. An evaluation plan, mixed methods, and a collaborative approach are useful tools in conducting the evaluation. ©, © SHAPE America.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059344718

These fusions drive constitutive expression and ligand-independent activation of the TRK kinase and are oncogenic. Larotrectinib is the first highly potent and selective small molecule ATP competitive inhibitor of all three TRK kinases to enter clinical development. Areas covered: This review covers the current preclinical and clinical evidence for TRK inhibitors for TRK fusion cancers, focusing on larotrectinib. Expert commentary: Larotrectinib has demonstrated a remarkable 75% centrally confirmed objective response rate in patients with TRK fusion cancers in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials with generally mild side effects. Responses appear independent of the patient’s age, underlying histology, and specific fusion partner and are durable in many patients. Larotrectinib is likely to be the first FDA-approved histology-agnostic molecularly targeted therapy.

This study aims to estimate national CPM trends in women with unilateral cT4M0 breast cancer. Methods: Women aged ≥ 18 years, who underwent mastectomy during 2004 to 2014 for unilateral cT4M0 breast cancer were identified using the National Cancer Database and grouped as all locally advanced (T4), chest wall invasion, skin nodule/ulceration, or both (T4abc), and inflammatory (T4d) cancer. Poisson regression for trends and logistic modeling for predictors of CPM were performed. Results: Of 23 943 women, 41% had T4abc disease and 35% T4d. Cumulative CPM rates were 15%, 23%, and 18%, for the T4abc, T4d, and all T4 groups, respectively.

Most studies have suggested an oncogenic role in breast cancer. We were interested in the relationship of miR-9 expression and survival in breast cancer and hypothesized that high expression of miR-9 was associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Materials and methods: We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas containing genetic and molecular data, clinical profiles, and survival information for 985 breast cancers. Survival analysis was performed comparing a group with low expression of miR-9 to a group with high expression. Expression of miR-9 was compared based on clinicopathological parameters. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed between the miR-9 high- and low-expression groups within the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cohort. Results: Low expression of miR-9 associated significantly with improved overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference in miR-9 expression with regard to disease-free survival. Smaller and early-stage tumors were associated with lower miR-9 expression. ER-positive breast cancers had lower levels of miR-9 than ER-negative breast cancers (P < 0.001), and within the ER-positive group, miR-9 expression was significantly associated with OS (P = 0.02).

Whether this risk varies with breastfeeding, family history of breast cancer, or specific tumor subtype has rarely been evaluated. Objective: To characterize breast cancer risk in relation to recent childbirth. Design: Pooled analysis of individual-level data from 15 prospective cohort studies. Setting: The international Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group. Participants: Women younger than 55 years. Measurements: During 9.6 million person-years of follow-up, 18 826 incident cases of breast cancer were diagnosed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for breast cancer were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Compared with nulliparous women, parous women had an HR for breast cancer that peaked about 5 years after birth (HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.63 to 1.99]) before decreasing to 0.77 (CI, 0.67 to 0.88) after 34 years. The association crossed over from positive to negative about 24 years after birth. The overall pattern was driven by estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer; no crossover was seen for ER-negative cancer. Increases in breast cancer risk after childbirth were pronounced when combined with a family history of breast cancer and were greater for women who were older at first birth or who had more births. Breastfeeding did not modify overall risk patterns. Limitations: Breast cancer diagnoses during pregnancy were not uniformly distinguishable from early postpartum diagnoses. Data on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene overexpression were limited. Conclusion: Compared with nulliparous women, parous women have an increased risk for breast cancer for more than 20 years after childbirth.

Methods: Participants in the Black Women’s Health Study, a prospective cohort of 59,000 African American women, reported birth weight, preterm birth, twin or triplet status, maternal age at birth, birth order, and having been breastfed during infancy at various times during follow-up from 1997 to 2015. Numbers of incident cases ranged from 312 for breastfed analyses to 1,583 for twin or triplet analyses. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between each factor and breast cancer risk overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) status. Results: Compared to birth weights of 5 lbs. 8 oz.–8 lbs. 13 oz., low (< 5 lbs. 8 oz.) and high (> 8 lbs. 13 oz.) birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk; HRs (95% CI) were 1.19 (0.98–1.44) and 1.26 (0.97–1.63), respectively.

Other perinatal factors were not associated with breast cancer. Conclusion: African American women with a low or high birth weight or born to older mothers may have increased breast cancer risk. Trends towards delayed child birth and higher birth weights, coupled with disproportionately high rates of low birth weight among African Americans, may contribute to increases in breast cancer incidence. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057600122

Results: Compared to ER+/PR+/HER2− patients without recurrence, those with recurrence had higher TWIST expression (p = 0.049) but lower ABL1/ABL2 activity (p = 0.003) in primary tumors. We also found that triple-negative breast cancer patients with recurrence had higher SNAI1 expression compared to those without recurrence (p = 0.03). After adjusting for potential confounders, the higher ABL1/ABL2 activity in primary tumors was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.85–0.90) among ER+/PR+/HER2− patients. In addition, among patients with recurrence we observed that the activity level of ABL1/ABL2 was significantly increased in recurrent tumors compared to the matched primary tumors regardless of the subtype (p = 0.013). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that the expression/activity level of various proteins may be differentially associated with risk of recurrence of breast tumor subtypes. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057784666

Methods: Evidence from the Vector Oncology Data Warehouse, a repository of electronic medical records/billing data and provider notes, was analyzed. Treatment outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from start of first-line therapy in the metastatic setting. HRU and cost measures were collected from the time of MBC diagnosis to end of the record. HRU included hospitalizations, emergency room visits, infused/parenteral supportive care drugs, and outpatient visits. Costs were computed both as total and monthly costs. Results: 57 HR+ and 57 TNBC patients (2013–2015) met inclusion criteria. Eight TNBC patients did not get treatment. HR+ patients had median first line PFS of 12.1 months and TNBC patients had 6.1 months. HR+ patients had median OS from start of first line of 38.4 months, and TNBC patients had 23.4 months.

Tumor infiltration by CD8 T cells correlates with improved prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and a significant effort is underway to improve CD8 T-cell antitumor activity. In this study, primary human immune cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients and used to demonstrate that the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine induces CD8 T-cell death. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that anchorage-independent TNBC utilizes the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) to inhibit CD8 T-cell viability. Publicly available data revealed that high TDO2, the gene encoding TDO, correlates with poor breast cancer clinical outcomes, including overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival, while expression of the gene encoding the more commonly studied tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, IDO1 did not. Metabolomic analysis, using quantitative mass spectrometry, of tryptophan and its catabolites, including kynurenine, in the plasma from presurgical breast cancer patients (n ¼ 77) and 40 cancer-free donors (n ¼ 40) indicated a strong correlation between substrate and catabolite in both groups. Interestingly, both tryptophan and kynurenine were lower in the plasma from patients with breast cancer compared with controls, particularly in women with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and stage III and IV breast cancer. Implications: This study underscores the importance of tryptophan catabolism, particularly in aggressive disease, and suggests that future pharmacologic efforts should focus on developing drugs that target both TDO and IDO1. 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057486620

Methods: A total of 208 BCFH+ girls (11–19 years old), with first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer or a mother with a BRCA1/2 mutation, and 112 BCFH− peers reported their health behaviors, beliefs, and psychosocial function. Results: Despite higher BCFH+ girls’ greater perceived breast cancer risk, there were no differences between BCFH+ and BCFH− girls on diet, exercise, alcohol initiation, or BSE. BCFH+ girls were slightly more likely to report trying cigarettes (11% vs. 5%, p =.04). In multivariable models with all girls, categorical associations with behaviors included the following: developmental and demographic factors with smoking, alcohol, diet, and exercise; family breast cancer history and experience with smoking, alcohol, and diet; psychosocial factors with smoking; girls perceptions of cancer controllability and mother support for health behaviors with alcohol, diet, exercise, and BSE; and mother behaviors with diet. Conclusions: Adolescent girls from BCFH+ families reported similar health behaviors to BCFH− peers, signaling that they are not translating their higher perceived risk into cancer control behaviors. Both uncontrollable (i.e., breast cancer experiences) and modifiable factors relate to health behaviors and warrant further investigation. Results indicate that interventions with teens and parents that target modifiable variables such as controllability perceptions, maternal modeling, and communication may relate to better health behaviors and reduced future breast cancer risk. © 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Final",,2-s2.0-85057891305

In this paper, we have proposed a method for breast cancer classification with the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN) model. The IRRCNN is a powerful DCNN model that combines the strength of the Inception Network (Inception-v4), the Residual Network (ResNet), and the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN). The IRRCNN shows superior performance against equivalent Inception Networks, Residual Networks, and RCNNs for object recognition tasks. In this paper, the IRRCNN approach is applied for breast cancer classification on two publicly available datasets including BreakHis and Breast Cancer (BC) classification challenge 2015. The experimental results are compared against the existing machine learning and deep learning–based approaches with respect to image-based, patch-based, image-level, and patient-level classification.

Materials and Methods: Computerized image analysis was used to quantify breast density and extract parenchymal texture features in a cross-sectional sample of women screened with digital mammography from September 1, 2012, to February 28, 2013 (n = 2029; age range, 35-75 years; mean age, 55.9 years). Unsupervised clustering was applied to identify and reproduce phenotypes of parenchymal complexity in separate training (n = 1339) and test sets (n = 690). Differences across phenotypes by age, body mass index, breast density, and estimated breast cancer risk were assessed by using Fisher exact, x2, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate preliminary associations between the detected phenotypes and breast cancer in an independent casecontrol sample (76 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 158 control participants) matched on age. Results: Unsupervised clustering in the screening sample identified four phenotypes with increasing parenchymal complexity that were reproducible between training and test sets (P = .001). Breast density was not strongly correlated with phenotype category (R2 = 0.24 for linear trend). The low- to intermediate-complexity phenotype (prevalence, 390 of 2029 [19%]) had the lowest proportion of dense breasts (eight of 390 [2.1%]), whereas similar proportions were observed across other phenotypes (from 140 of 291 [48.1%] in the high-complexity phenotype to 275 of 511 [53.8%] in the low-complexity phenotype). In the independent case-control sample, phenotypes showed a significant association with breast cancer (P = .001), resulting in higher discriminatory capacity when added to a model with breast density and body mass index (area under the curve, 0.84 vs 0.80; P = .03 for comparison).

Radiation therapy (RT) is an important treatment modality for managing breast cancer; however, we previously showed that RT can also reprogram a fraction of the surviving breast cancer cells into breast cancer–initiating cells (BCICs), which are thought to contribute to disease recurrence. In this study, we characterize mebendazole (MBZ) as a drug with potential to prevent the occurrence of radiation-induced reprogramming and improve the effect of RT in patients with TNBC. Methods and Materials: A high-throughput screen was used to identify drugs that prevented radiation-induced conversion of TNBC cells into cells with a cancer-initiating phenotype and exhibited significant toxicity toward TNBC cells. MBZ was one of the drug hits that fulfilled these criteria. In additional studies, we used BCIC markers and mammosphere-forming assays to investigate the effect of MBZ on the BCIC population. Staining with propidium iodide, annexin-V, and γ-H2AX was used to determine the effect of MBZ on cell cycle, apoptosis, and double-strand breaks. Finally, the potential for MBZ to enhance the effect of RT in TNBC was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: MBZ efficiently depletes the BCIC pool and prevents the ionizing radiation–induced conversion of breast cancer cells into therapy-resistant BCICs. In addition, MBZ arrests cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and causes double-strand breaks and apoptosis. MBZ sensitizes TNBC cells to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved tumor control in a human xenograft model of TNBC. Conclusions: The data presented in this study support the repurposing of MBZ as a combination treatment with RT in patients with TNBC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057818436

Sixty-one patients who subsequently developed breast cancer were matched 1:2 by age and high-risk indication with patients who did not develop breast cancer (n = 122). Five fellowship-trained breast radiologists independently recorded the BPE. The median reader BPE for each case was calculated and compared between the cancer and control cohorts. Results: Cancer cohort patients were high-risk because of a history of radiation therapy (10%, 6 of 61), high-risk lesion (18%, 11 of 61), or breast cancer (30%, 18 of 61); BRCA mutation (18%, 11 of 61); or family history (25%, 15 of 61).

Deregulation of TJ is a hallmark of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to carcinoma progression and metastasis. However, the signaling mechanisms linking TJ to the induction of EMT are not understood. Here, we identify a TJ-based signalosome, which controls AKT signaling and EMT in breast cancer. The coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CXADR), a TJ protein with an essential yet uncharacterized role in organogenesis and tissue homeostasis, was identified as a key component of the signalosome. CXADR regulated the stability and function of the phosphatases and AKT inhibitors PTEN and PHLPP2. Loss of CXADR led to hyperactivation of AKT and sensitized cells to TGFb1–induced EMT. Conversely, restoration of CXADR stabilized PHLPP2 and PTEN, inhibited AKT, and promoted epithelial differentiation. Loss of CXADR in luminal A breast cancer correlated with loss of PHLPP2 and PTEN and poor prognosis. These results show that CXADR promotes the formation of an AKT-inhibitory signalosome at TJ and regulates epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer cells. Moreover, loss of CXADR might be used as a prognostic marker in luminal breast cancer.

Understanding the survival profiles among subtypes by treatment status could impact optimal selection of treatments. Methods: Patients were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from the community hospitals across four geographical regions of the United States. Expression of hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 in tumor specimens from 1169 patients was centrally determined by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ; breast cancer was classified into HR + /HER2 − , HR + /HER2 + , triple-negative, and HER2 + subtypes. Overall survival (OS) at a median follow-up of about 15 years among subtypes in untreated patients and those with systemic treatments and radiotherapy was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier method and multivariable analysis adjusting for age, tumor size and grade, number of positive nodes, stage and breast cancer subtypes. Results: Without treatment, breast cancer subtypes were not associated with OS (P = 0.983) and remained insignificant for prognosis by multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounders. This contrasted with a significant survival difference across the subtypes in patients with conventional therapies (P &lt; 0.0001).

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the 2009 guideline changes on breast cancer incidence by stage among women aged 40–49 and 50–74 years in the U.S. Methods: This was a cross-sectional trend analysis of the impact of 2009 guideline change on breast cancer incidence by stage, using data from the National Program for Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Incidence–U.S. Cancer Statistics 2001–2014 database among women aged 40–74 years. Incidence was age adjusted to the U.S. standard population. Data were collected in 2001–2014, released in 2017, and analyzed in 2018. Results: Among women aged 40–49 years, the 4-year average annual incidence of breast cancer increased slightly in 2011–2014 for in situ, localized, and distant cancer, but decreased for regional cancer compared with the incidence in 2006–2009. Among women aged 50–74 years, the 4-year average annual incidence of breast cancer increased in 2011–2014 for localized and distant cancer, but decreased for in situ and regional cancer. Joinpoint analyses revealed that annual percentage changes decreased after 2009 for distant cancer among both women aged 40–49 and 50–74 years.

We validated the model in an independent cohort of 252,997 women in the Chicago area. We evaluated calibration using the ratio of expected to observed (E/O) invasive breast cancers in the cohort and discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: In an independent cohort of 252,997 women (median age 50 years, 26% non-Hispanic Black), the BCSC model was well calibrated (E/O = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–0.98), but underestimated the incidence of invasive breast cancer in younger women and in women with low mammographic density. The AUROC was 0.633, similar to that observed in prior validation studies. Conclusions: The BCSC model is a well-validated risk assessment tool for breast cancer that may be particularly useful when assessing the utility of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061967790

Research investigating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for breast cancer patients during this period is limited. This randomized controlled pilot study examined the effect of a brief lovingkindness meditation intervention on these key outcomes. Methods: Participants were 60 women who underwent core needle breast biopsy, received an abnormal biopsy result, and underwent breast surgery (White = 73.6%; African American = 22.6%; Asian American = 3.8%; Age M = 56). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions at breast biopsy: (1) lovingkindness meditation, (2) music, and (3) usual care. Assessments of anxiety, pain, fatigue, physiologic reactivity, and self-compassion occurred prior to patients’ biopsy, following biopsy, 1 week after receipt of biopsy results, and 1 week following breast surgery. Results: Multilevel modeling analyses demonstrated that lovingkindness meditation significantly improved pain (p = 0.02), self-compassion (p = 0.004), and heart rate (p = 0.02) over time compared to control conditions. There was a trend for anxiety (p = 0.05). Music significantly improved pain (p = 0.04) compared to usual care. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a lovingkindness meditation intervention for breast cancer patients during the diagnostic and surgical period. Improving psychological and physical well-being during this time frame has the potential to improve longer-term health outcomes during adjuvant treatment and survivorship. Interventions that cultivate positive adjustment during the diagnostic and surgical period of breast cancer are an important area of future research. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85060843251

It is important to identify predictors of contralateral cancer in order to make informed decisions about bilateral mastectomy. The impact of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (i.e., oophorectomy) on the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is unclear. Thus, we conducted a prospective study of the relationship between oophorectomy and the risk of contralateral breast cancer in 1781 BRCA1 and 503 BRCA2 mutation carriers with breast cancer. Methods: Women were followed from the date of diagnosis of their first breast cancer until the date of diagnosis of a contralateral breast cancer, bilateral mastectomy, date of death, or date of last follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of contralateral breast cancer associated with oophorectomy. Oophorectomy was included as a time-dependent covariate. We performed a left-censored analysis for those women who reported a primary breast cancer prior to study entry (i.e., from completion of baseline questionnaire). Results: After an average of 9.8 years of follow-up, there were 179 (7.8%) contralateral breast cancers diagnosed. Oophorectomy was not associated with the risk of developing a second breast cancer (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.68–1.25). The relationship did not vary by BRCA mutation type or by age at diagnosis of the first breast cancer. There was some evidence for a decreased risk of contralateral breast cancer among women with an ER-positive primary breast cancer, but this was based on a small number of events (n = 240). Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that oophorectomy has little impact on the risk of contralateral breast cancer. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061609644

ESR1-activating mutations in the ligand-binding domain have been reported in up to 35–40% of ER-positive metastatic breast cancers and are associated with endocrine therapy resistance and disease progression. At present, it is unclear whether ESR1 mutations alter the immunohistochemical detection of ER performed in routine clinical practice. In this study, ESR1 mutations in breast cancer were identified utilizing Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a Food and Drug Administration-approved hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay. Five hundred and eighty-six breast cancers from patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease were analyzed using MSK-IMPACT in the study period. ESR1 somatic alterations were identified in 67 breast cancer samples from 66 patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of ER, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was performed on the primary and treated breast cancers from these patients at the time of diagnosis. Twenty unique ESR1 mutations were identified involving the ligand-binding domain, all in breast cancer samples from patients previously treated with endocrine therapy. The most frequent mutations were D538G (n = 22), Y537S (n = 7), and E380Q (n = 7). All breast cancer samples with an ESR1 mutation were ER-positive by immunohistochemistry. Review of the ER immunohistochemistry in the paired untreated primary tumor and treated tumor from 34 patients showed no detectable change in the ER-positive immunohistochemical status (median percentage of invasive tumor cells with nuclear staining: untreated primary tumor 90%, treated tumor 95%). We conclude that ESR1 mutations do not appreciably diminish ER-positive staining by immunohistochemistry. In addition to standard biomarker testing by immunohistochemistry, the assessment of ESR1 mutations by molecular testing can help guide the clinical management of patients with ER-positive breast cancer in the setting of endocrine resistance and progression of disease. © 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053329002

Differences in LTW were assessed using the TDC method for three sites in the upper limbs, three sites in the lateral thorax and two sites on the back. Additional measures included demographic and clinical characteristics, arm circumference and bioimpedance analysis. For the 112 survivors without LE, no differences in TDC values were found between the affected and unaffected sides for the first dorsal web space, ventral forearm and upper arm, and upper and lower back. Compared to the unaffected side, TDC values were significantly higher on the affected side for the upper, mid and lower lateral thorax. For the 78 survivors with LE, compared to the unaffected side, TDC was significantly higher on the affected side for all of the sites evaluated except the hand web space. Our findings support the use of the TDC method to detect differences in upper extremity and truncal oedema in survivors with LE following breast cancer treatment.

Patients with HER2 + and estrogen receptor–positive (ER + ) cancer are additionally treated with long-term hormone therapy. This study examined the metastatic pattern and prognosis of both ER + /HER2 + and ER−/HER2 + breast cancer. Patients and Methods: A total of 54,147 patients with HER2 + breast cancer from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB, 2010-2013) and 31,946 patients with HER2 + breast cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER, 2010-2014) were examined. Sites of metastasis and overall survival (OS) were examined in the NCDB, while OS and breast cancer–specific survival were examined in the SEER database. Results: Compared to ER−/HER2 + breast cancer, ER + /HER2 + breast cancer was more likely to metastasize to bone but less likely to brain, liver, and lung and less likely to result in multiple metastases. In univariate analysis based on the NCDB, patients with ER−/HER2 + breast cancer had worse OS in all metastasis subsets, including patients who received HER2-targeted therapy. This poor survival for ER−/HER2 + persisted in patients with metastasis to bone and lung, and multiple metastases. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, tumor grade, surgery, chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, and hormone therapy, ER−/HER2 + patients with bone metastasis still had worse OS. In the SEER, ER−/HER2 + patients had both worse OS and breast cancer–specific survival in univariate analysis.

Materials and Methods: In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective study, 40 patients (all female, ages 32–80 years, mean 52 years) gave informed consent prior to undergoing contrast enhanced breast PET/MRI from 3/2015 to 2/2018. Of the 40 patients, 6 were excluded for multicentric or bilateral cancers, 1 for current lactation and 6 because the raw data from their scans were corrupted. The remaining 27 patients (all female, ages 33 to 80 years, mean age 53 years) comprised the study population. Prone PET and contrast-enhanced MR data were acquired simultaneously on a 3-T integrated PET/ MR system. BPU was measured as SUVmax of a 1.5 cm 3 volume of interest 1) in the same quadrant of the ipsilateral breast, 5 mm from the index lesion; 2) in the opposite quadrant of the ipsilateral breast; and 3) in contralateral breast, quadrant matched to the opposite quadrant of the ipsilateral breast. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the index cancer was measured using a VOI that included the entire volume of the index lesion. Bleed from the primary tumor was corrected for (PET edge, MIM). FGT and BPE was assessed by 2 readers on a 4-point scale in accordance with BI-RADS lexicon. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Spearman rank correlation test were performed. Results: BPU was significantly greater in the same quadrant as the breast cancer as compared with the opposite quadrant of the same breast (p &lt; 0.001 for both readers) and was significantly greater in the opposite quadrant of the same breast compared to the matched quadrant of the contralateral breast (p = 0.002 for reader 1 and &lt;0.001 for reader 2). While the FGT SUVmax in the same quadrant as the cancer correlated significantly with SUVmax of the index lesion, the FGT SUVmax in the opposite quadrant of the same breast and in the matched quadrant of the contralateral breast did not. The FGT SUVmax in the contralateral breast positively correlated with the degree of BPE and negatively correlated with age, but did not show a significant correlation with the amount of FGT for either reader.

Methods: Women from five medical centers were surveyed before their screening mammographic examinations. Participants were queried on their baseline anxiety and demographics, then asked how many times in the past month they had thought about developing breast cancer. Participants were then notified of the 12% lifetime average breast cancer risk and asked to estimate their personal risk both subjectively and objectively. Comparisons were made between responses and the demographic variables. Results: There were 2,747 completed surveys for analysis. Women reported 2.5 ± 6.6 thoughts of cancer on average in the prior month. More frequent thoughts were associated with personal or family history of breast cancer, greater anxiety, and genetic testing (P <.001 for all). Among women without cancer risk factors (n = 1,412), there were 1.4 cancer thoughts per month, which was associated with baseline anxiety (P <.001). The median lifetime breast cancer risk was 12% among all women, with 37.4% high risk (>20%) estimates. Demographic variables associated with increased risk estimates were previous cancer diagnosis, higher education, genetic testing, white race, increased age, and greater anxiety (P <.01 for all). Among women with no risk factors, the median estimated risk was 10%, with 16.7% providing estimates greater than 20%, associated with baseline anxiety and white race (P <.001 for both).

Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key enzyme in glycolysis, is highly expressed in a variety of tumors and catalyzes pyruvate to lactate. In the present study, we first analyzed the association and clinical significance of p53 and LDHA in breast cancer expressing wild-type p53 (wt-p53) and found that LDHA mRNA levels are negatively correlated with wt-p53 but not with mutation p53 mRNA levels, and low p53 and high LDHA expression are significantly associated with poor overall survival rates. Furthermore, p53 negatively regulates LDHA expression by directly binding its promoter region. Moreover, a series of LDHA gain-of-function and rescore experiments were carried out in breast cancer MCF7 cells expressing endogenous wt-p53, showing that ectopic expression of p53 decreases aerobic glycolysis, cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation of breast cancer cells and that restoration of the expression of LDHA in p53-overexpressing cells could abolish the suppressive effect of p53 on aerobic glycolysis and other malignant phenotypes. In conclusion, our findings showed that repression of LDHA induced by wt-p53 blocks tumor growth and invasion through downregulation of aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer, providing new insights into the mechanism by which p53 contributes to the development and progression of breast cancer. © 2019 The Authors.

We evaluated the effects of two epigenetic-modifying compounds on markers of growth potential in several triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor currently used in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, was administered to triple-negative breast cancer cells alone or in combination with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor isolated from green tea. The compounds affected the expression of oncogenic miR-221/222 and tumor suppressors, p27 and PTEN, in addition to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). E-cadherin expression was increased while N-cadherin was decreased, indicating a more epithelial phenotype. In addition, the activity of DNMTs was diminished with the treatments, and there was a significant enrichment of AcH3 within the promoter of p27 and PTEN, suggesting a role of epigenetic mechanisms for the aforementioned changes. These results translated to reduced migration of the triple-negative breast cancer cells with the treatments. Together, these findings support the role of SAHA and EGCG in limiting growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells. © 2018 by the authors.

Objectives The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of patient-and tumor-related factors that influenced the choice of mastectomy with CPM as treatment for early-stage breast cancer at an academic medical center in New Jersey. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 10 years of breast cancer data including 1556 women aged 40 to 80 years treated for breast cancer at an academic medical center. Logistic regression models identified possible associations between type of surgery and various patient-and tumor-related characteristics. Results Women most likely to be treated with CPM were younger (P <.0001), white (P =.003), and privately insured (P <.0001). Factors that increased the odds of receiving CPM included year of surgery (odds ratio, 1.441; confidence interval, 1.328-1.564) and residing in a relatively wealthy community (odds ratio, 11.159; confidence interval, 3.467-35.917). Conclusions The rate of CPM as a treatment for unilateral breast cancer continues to rise, and this treatment decision seems to be relatively independent of tumor-related factors and clinical evidence of efficacy. More research is needed to ascertain why women are choosing this surgical option. Implications for Practice The large majority who are choosing CPM are doing so regardless of the lack of clinical efficacy, yet there are few articles in the nursing literature preparing nurses to understand and counsel these women who may be asking for advice.

An effective approach to decrease the burden of breast cancer is prevention. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an educational model, called the ASSISTS, for promoting breast cancer-preventive behaviors in women. Methods A multiphase method was used to develop the model designed to promote breast cancer prevention behaviors. A conceptual model was generated based on a secondary analysis of qualitative data. Then, a structural equation model technique was used to test the relationships among the model constructs. Results The analysis revealed that 7 constructs could be extracted, namely, perceived social support, attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, information seeking, stress management, and self-care. Based on these constructs, a conceptual model was built and tested using structural equation modeling. The model fit was good, and the model confirmed significant relationships among the 7 constructs of breast cancer prevention. Conclusion Findings revealed that self-care behavior and stress management are influenced directly by attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, information seeking, and social support. In addition, women seek more information when they are motivated, have more self-efficacy, have a more positive attitude toward breast cancer prevention, and experience more social support. Implication for Practice Cancer nurses can be at the forefront of breast cancer prevention. Because they can play a pivotal role in providing information, they can reduce women's stress and increase their self-care behavior. In addition, their social support can positively influence Iranian women's attitude, motivation, and self-care behavior. Furthermore, implementing educational programs based on this model might encourage women to practice preventive behaviors. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods Stage IA to IIB breast cancer survivors who were 1 to 5 years posttreatment completed OE questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to examine OE accessibility and importance. Results The sample (n = 73) was 91.8% white, 5.4% African American, 1.4% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 1.4% other. The mean age was 58 (SD, 9.6) years. Outcome expectation importance mean was 6.1 (SD, 0.4), indicating OEs are overall ""important.""

Since 1990, breast cancer mortality rates have fallen between 1.8% and 3.4% per year, a decrease that is attributed to increased mammography screening and improved treatment. Methods: The authors used age-adjusted female breast cancer mortality rate and population data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to estimate the number of breast cancer deaths averted by screening mammography and improved treatment since 1989. Four different assumptions regarding background mortality rates (in the absence of screening mammography and improved treatment) were used to estimate deaths averted for women aged 40 to 84 years by taking the difference between SEER-reported mortality rates and background mortality rates for each 5-year age group, multiplied by the population for each 5-year age group. SEER data were used to estimate annual and cumulative breast cancer deaths averted in 2012 and 2015 and extrapolated SEER data were used to estimate deaths averted in 2018. Results: The number of single-year breast cancer deaths averted ranged from 20,860 to 33,842 in 2012, from 23,703 to 39,415 in 2015, and from 27,083 to 45,726 in 2018. Breast cancer mortality reductions ranged from 38.6% to 50.5% in 2012, from 41.5% to 54.2% in 2015, and from 45.3% to 58.3% in 2018.

The Breast Cancer Genetics Referral Screening Tool (B-RST™) was created and validated to easily identify individuals at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer for referral to cancer genetics services. The purpose of this study was to revise B-RST™ to maximize sensitivity against BRCA1/2 mutation status. Methods: We analyzed pedigrees of 277 individuals who had undergone BRCA1/2 testing to determine modifications to the B-RST™ 2.0 algorithm that would maximize sensitivity for mutations, while maintaining simplicity. We used McNemar’s chi-square test to compare validation measures between the revised version (3.0) and the 2.0 version. Results: Algorithmic changes made to B-RST™ 2.0 increased the sensitivity against BRCA1/2 mutation analysis from 71.1 to 94.0% (P < 0.0001).

There is a need to better differentiate when a breast biopsy is warranted and determine appropriate follow-up. This study describes the design and clinical performance of a combinatorial proteomic biomarker assay (CPBA), Videssa Breast, in women over age 50 years. Experimental Design: A BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 assessment was required for clinical trial enrollment. Serum was collected prior to breast biopsy and subjects were followed for 6–12 months and clinically relevant outcomes were recorded. Samples were split into training (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts with an approximate 1:4 case:control ratio in both arms. Results: A CPBA that combines biomarker data with patient clinical data was developed using a training cohort (469 women, cancer incidence: 18.5%), resulting in 94% sensitivity and 97% negative predictive value (NPV). Independent validation of the final algorithm in 194 subjects (breast cancer incidence: 19.6%) demonstrated a sensitivity of 95% and a NPV of 97%.

The study aimed to determine whether the HPV-genotypes are identifiable in papilloma or carcinoma of the breast by real-time PCR with broad-spectrum genotyping. Methods: Formalin-fixed-paraffin-blocks obtained from the patients who were suffering from PND and underwent ductoscopic papilloma extraction (n = 27) or segmental/total mastectomy for cancer diagnosis (n = 18). HPV-DNAs were identified by PCR with broad-spectrum genotyping. Mc Nemar test was used to compare cancer-involved cases to normal-adjacent tissue concerning HPV positivity. Chi-Square test was used to analyze the association for receptor status in HPV positive cancer-involved cases. Results: The mean age (±SD) was 49 ± 16 in papilloma and 52 ± 14 in BC patients, respectively. We found high prevalence of HPV in papilloma and carcinoma: 29.6% (n = 8) and 44.4% (n = 8), respectively.

Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized to identify all pediatric patients with malignant breast tumors between 1973 and 2014. Analysis was performed using Stata Statistical Software version 13.1. Associations between categorical variables were made using X 2 test. Log-rank test was used for univariate survival analysis. Kaplan–Meier analysis investigated five-year survival rates across several variables. Adjusted analysis was performed using a Cox Proportional-Hazards regression. Results: 134 patients with breast malignancies were identified. Carcinoma was the most prevalent histology (48.5%), followed by fibroepithelial tumors (FETs) (35.1%), and sarcoma (14.2%). FETs were twice as common in black compared to nonblack patients (56.3% vs. 29.0%, p &lt; 0.01). Analyzing histology by stage revealed that 100% of FETs were early stage disease (p &lt; 0.0001). 46.7% of the tumors tested were ER/PR negative, more than twice as many compared to the published adult estimate of 20.0%. Unadjusted survival analysis revealed worse survival for patients with adenocarcinoma/sarcomas, advanced stage, and high grade disease, without a survival difference between races. Conclusion: Breast cancer remains a rare malignancy among pediatric patients. Although black patients were found to have more noncarcinomatous tumors with less advanced disease, this did not confer a survival advantage. Type of study: Retrospective cohort study.

Experimental Design: ERBB2 mutation frequency was determined from large genomic databases. Isogenic knock-in ERBB2 mutations in ERþ MCF7 cells and xenografts were used to investigate estrogen-independent growth. Structural analysis was used to determine the molecular interaction of HER L755S with HER3. Small molecules and siRNAs were used to inhibit PI3Ka, TORC1, and HER3. Results: Genomic data revealed a higher rate of ERBB2 mutations in metastatic versus primary ERþ tumors. MCF7 cells with isogenically incorporated ERBB2 kinase domain mutations exhibited resistance to estrogen deprivation and to fulvestrant both in vitro and in vivo, despite maintaining inhibition of ERa transcriptional activity. Addition of the irreversible HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib restored sensitivity to fulvestrant. HER2-mutant MCF7 cells expressed higher levels of p-HER3, p-AKT, and p-S6 than cells with wild-type HER2. Structural analysis of the HER2 L755S variant implicated a more flexible active state, potentially allowing for enhanced dimerization with HER3. Treatment with a PI3Ka inhibitor, a TORC1 inhibitor or HER3 siRNA, but not a MEK inhibitor, restored sensitivity to fulvestrant and to estrogen deprivation. Inhibition of mutant HER2 or TORC1, when combined with fulvestrant, equipotently inhibited growth of MCF7/ERBB2 V777L xenografts, suggesting a role for TORC1 in antiestrogen resistance induced by ERBB2 mutations. Conclusions: ERBB2 mutations hyperactivate the HER3/ PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, leading to antiestrogen resistance in ERþ breast cancer. Dual blockade of the HER2 and ER pathways is required for the treatment of ERþ/HER2 mutant breast cancers. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059466830

However, most of these studies only included non-Hispanic White individuals. Methods: To fill this gap, we performed a two-step (discovery and validation) metabolomics profiling in plasma samples from 358 breast cancer patients and 138 healthy controls. All study subjects were either Hispanics or non-Hispanic African Americans. Results: A panel of 14 identified metabolites significantly differed between breast cancer cases and healthy controls in both the discovery and validation sets. Most of these identified metabolites were lipids. In the pathway analysis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), arginine and proline metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism pathways were observed, and they significantly differed between breast cancer cases and healthy controls in both sets. From those 14 metabolites, we selected 9 non-correlated metabolites to generate a metabolic risk score. Increased metabolites risk score was associated with a 1.87- and 1.63-fold increased risk of breast cancer in the discovery and validation sets, respectively (Odds ratio (OR) 1.87, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.50, 2.32; OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.36, 1.95). Conclusions: In summary, our study identified metabolic profiles and pathways that significantly differed between breast cancer cases and healthy controls in Hispanic or non-Hispanic African American women.

Methods: Women with breast cancer were recruited between 2009 and 2018. The Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test (BOMC) was administered prior to chemotherapy. Associations between baseline BOMC and functional (Karnofsky Self-Reported Performance Rating Scale (KPS), Time Up and Go Test (TUG), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Physical Function, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)), psychosocial (Mental Health Inventory-13, MOS Social Activity Limitation and Social Support Survey), medical, and socio-demographic variables were assessed using linear regression analysis. Results: In a sample of 331 women with breast cancer, the mean age was 65.2 years and 68.6% were 65 and older. Mean BOMC score was 3.60 on a scale from 0 (best) to 28 (worst).

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess whether this association is causal. Sixty independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated at P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 with BW were used to construct (1) a 41-SNP instrumental variable (IV) for univariable MR after removing SNPs with pleiotropic associations with other breast cancer risk factors and (2) a 49-SNP IV for multivariable MR after filtering SNPs for data availability. BW predicted by the 41-SNP IV was not associated with overall breast cancer risk in inverse-variance weighted (IVW) univariable MR analysis of genetic association data from 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls (odds ratio = 0.86 per 500 g higher BW; 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.01). Sensitivity analyses using four alternative methods and three alternative IVs, including an IV with 59 of the 60 BW-associated SNPs, yielded similar results. Multivariable MR adjusting for the effects of the 49-SNP IV on birth length, adult height, adult body mass index, age at menarche, and age at menopause using IVW and MR-Egger methods provided estimates consistent with univariable analyses. Results were also similar when all analyses were repeated after restricting to estrogen receptor-positive or -negative breast cancer cases. Point estimates of the odds ratios from most analyses performed indicated an inverse relationship between genetically-predicted BW and breast cancer, but we are unable to rule out an association between the non-genetically-determined component of BW and breast cancer. Thus, genetically-predicted higher BW was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in adult life in our MR study. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061279075

Cancer-related economic burden is exacerbated by adverse treatment effects. Strategies to resolve the economic burden caused by breast cancer and its adverse treatment effects have stemmed from the perspectives of health care providers, oncology navigators, and other subject-matter experts. For the current study, patient-driven recommendations were elicited to reduce economic burden after 1) breast cancer and 2) breast cancer-related lymphedema, which is a common, persistent adverse effect of breast cancer. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 40 long-term breast cancer survivors who were residents of Pennsylvania or New Jersey in 2015 and were enrolled in a 6-month observational study. Purposive sampling ensured equal representation by age, socioeconomic position, and lymphedema diagnosis. Semistructured interviews addressed economic challenges, supports used, and patient recommendations for reducing financial challenges. Interviews were coded, and representative quotes from the patient recommendations were analyzed and reported to illustrate key findings. Results: Of 40 interviewees (mean age, 64 years; mean time since diagnosis, 12 years), 27 offered recommendations to reduce the economic burden caused by cancer and its adverse treatment effects. Nine recommendations emerged across 4 major themes: expanding affordable insurance and insurance-covered items, especially for lymphedema treatment (among the 60% who reported lymphedema); supportive domestic help; financial assistance from diagnosis through treatment; and employment-preserving policies. Conclusions: The current study yielded 9 actionable, patient-driven recommendations—changes to insurance, supportive services, financial assistance, and protective policies—to reduce breast cancer-related economic burden. These recommendations should be tested through policy and programmatic interventions. © 2019 The Authors.

Systematic investigation of the genetic contributions to breast and ovarian cancers is needed to confirm these findings and explore potentially new associations. Objective: To confirm reported and identify additional predisposition genes for breast or ovarian cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this sample of 11416 patients with clinical features of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both who were referred for genetic testing from 1200 hospitals and clinics across the United States and of 3988 controls who were referred for genetic testing for noncancer conditions between 2014 and 2015, whole-exome sequencing was conducted and gene-phenotype associations were examined. Case-control analyses using the Genome Aggregation Database as a set of reference controls were also conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast cancer risk associated with pathogenic variants among 625 cancer predisposition genes; association of identified predisposition breast or ovarian cancer genes with the breast cancer subtypes invasive ductal, invasive lobular, hormone receptor-positive, hormone receptor-negative, and male, and with early-onset disease. Results: Of 9639 patients with breast cancer, 3960 (41.1%) were early-onset cases (≤45 years at diagnosis) and 123 (1.3%) were male, with men having an older age at diagnosis than women (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [12.8] vs 48.6 [11.4] years). Of 2051 women with ovarian cancer, 445 (21.7%) received a diagnosis at 45 years or younger. Enrichment of pathogenic variants were identified in 4 non-BRCA genes associated with breast cancer risk: ATM (odds ratio [OR], 2.97; 95% CI, 1.67-5.68), CHEK2 (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.40-3.56), PALB2 (OR, 5.53; 95% CI, 2.24-17.65), and MSH6 (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.35-5.44). Increased risk for ovarian cancer was associated with 4 genes: MSH6 (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.95-9.47), RAD51C (OR, not estimable; false-discovery rate-corrected P =.004), TP53 (OR, 18.50; 95% CI, 2.56-808.10), and ATM (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.30-6.32). Neither the MRN complex genes nor CDKN2A was associated with increased breast or ovarian cancer risk. The findings also do not support previously reported breast cancer associations with the ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D, or mismatch repair genes MSH2 and PMS2. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this large-scale exome sequencing of patients and controls shed light on both well-established and controversial non-BRCA predisposition gene associations with breast or ovarian cancer reported to date and may implicate additional breast or ovarian cancer susceptibility gene candidates involved in DNA repair and genomic maintenance. © 2018 American Medical Association.

The impact of guideline discordance on cost and health care utilization is unclear. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study of Medicare claims data from 2012 to 2015 included women age ≥65 with stage I–III breast cancer receiving care within the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Community Network. Concordance with NCCN guidelines was assessed for treatment regimens. Costs to Medicare and health care utilization were identified from start of cancer treatment until death or available follow-up. Adjusted monthly cost and utilization rates were estimated using linear mixed effect and generalized linear models. Results: Of 1,177 patients, 16% received guideline-discordant treatment, which was associated with nonwhite race, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor negative, human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) positive, and later-stage cancer. Discordant therapy was primarily related to reduced-intensity treatments (single-agent chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy without chemotherapy, bevacizumab without chemotherapy, platinum combinations without anthracyclines). In adjusted models, average monthly costs for guideline-discordant patients were $936 higher compared with concordant (95% confidence limits $611, $1,260). For guideline-discordant patients, adjusted rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations per thousand observations were 25% higher (49.9 vs. 39.9) and 19% higher (24.0 vs. 20.1) per month than concordant patients, respectively. Conclusion: One in six patients with early-stage breast cancer received guideline-discordant care, predominantly related to undertreatment, which was associated with higher costs and rates of health care utilization. Additional randomized trials are needed to test lower-toxicity regimens and guide clinicians in treatment for older breast cancer patients. Implications for Practice: Previous studies lack details about types of deviations from chemotherapy guidelines that occur in older early-stage breast cancer patients. Understanding the patterns of guideline discordance and its impact on patient outcomes will be particularly important for these patients. This study found 16% received guideline-discordant care, predominantly related to reduced intensity treatment and associated with higher costs and rates of health care utilization. Increasing older adult participation in clinical trials should be a priority in order to fill the knowledge gap about how to treat older, less fit patients with breast cancer. © AlphaMed Press 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85054854551

Previous research suggests a link between ambivalence over emotional expression (AEE) and physical functioning. The current study built upon this research by examining post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) as a mechanism. Further, we also examined the moderating effects of mainstream cultural orientation. To this end, we tested study hypotheses using moderated mediation models. Methods: Participants were 96 Chinese-speaking breast cancer survivors in the USA. Participants were diagnosed within the past five years with stages 0–III breast cancer. Participants completed questionnaires related to AEE, PTSS, SF-36 physical functioning, and role limitations due to physical health subscales, and acculturation. Results: Results from moderated mediation models provided support for study hypotheses. AEE was positively related to overall PTSS and its three subscales (i.e., re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance, and arousal). Further, PTSS and the three subscales were negatively related to physical functioning and positively related to role limitations due to physical health. The indirect effects of AEE on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health through PTSS and the three subscales were significant. Moderated mediation models showed that the indirect effects of AEE on physical functioning through PTSS and the re-experiencing subscale were stronger for those high, compared to low, in mainstream culture orientation. Conclusion: Those with high AEE experience had worse physical functioning and greater role limitations due to increased PTSS. However, the indirect effects were stronger for those who endorse greater mainstream culture. Implications for results suggest that interventions aimed at addressing AEE and PTSS may help alleviate physical health problems especially those high in mainstream culture orientation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Final",,2-s2.0-85049134551

Methods and Materials: Between 2005 and 2017, 2171 women (with 2266 at-risk arms) who received surgery for unilateral or bilateral breast cancer at our institution were enrolled. Perometry was used to objectively assess limb volume preoperatively, and lymphedema was defined as a ≥10% relative arm-volume increase arising >3 months postoperatively. Multivariable regression was used to uncover risk factors associated with lymphedema, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate lymphedema incidence, and the semiannual hazard rate of lymphedema was calculated. Results: With a median follow-up of 4 years, the overall estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 13.7%. Significant factors associated with lymphedema on multivariable analysis were high preoperative body mass index, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and regional lymph node radiation (RLNR). Patients receiving ALND with RLNR experienced the highest 5-year rate of lymphedema (31.2%), followed by those receiving ALND without RLNR (24.6%) and sentinel lymph node biopsy with RLNR (12.2%). Overall, the risk of lymphedema peaked between 12 and 30 months postoperatively; however, the time course varied as a function of therapy received. Early-onset lymphedema (<12 months postoperatively) was associated with ALND (HR [hazard ratio], 4.75; P <.0001) but not with RLNR (HR, 1.21; P =.55). In contrast, late-onset lymphedema (>12 months postoperatively) was associated with RLNR (HR, 3.86; P =.0001) and, to a lesser extent, ALND (HR, 1.86; P =.029). The lymphedema risk peaked between 6 and 12 months in the ALND-without-RLNR group, between 18 and 24 months in the ALND-with-RLNR group, and between 36 and 48 months in the group receiving sentinel lymph node biopsy with RLNR. Conclusions: The time course for lymphedema development depends on the breast cancer treatment received.

This study evaluated the health benefits of an expressive writing intervention among breast cancer patients in mainland China. Methods: Stage I-III Chinese breast cancer survivors undergoing chemotherapy were recruited in Shanghai, China. They (n = 90) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a positive thinking group (PTC) to write about the positive aspects of their cancer experience; a self-regulation condition (SRC) to write about their stress and coping efforts, deepest feelings, and positive aspects of their cancer experience; or a cancer-fact group (CFC) to write about facts relevant to their cancer experience. All groups wrote for 30 min every week for 4 weeks. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B at baseline and 1- and 2-month follow-ups. Linear mixed effects models were used to test the hypotheses that the SRC and PTC would improve QOL compared to the CFC. Results: QOL improved overtime in the whole sample. Contrary to hypotheses, the CFC had increased QOL compared with the SRC from baseline to both the 1- and 2-month follow-ups (ΔQOL = 9.31, p = 0.01, d = 0.44; ΔQOL = 9.45, p = 0.025, d = 0.49). The PTC did not differ from cancer-fact writing but had increased QOL compared with the SRC from baseline to both the 1- and 2-month follow-ups (ΔQOL = 7.44, p = 0.04, d = 0.35; ΔQOL = 11.72, p = 0.06, d = 0.61).

In this pilot study, IRB-approved, prospective study, nine patients with ten suspicious breast lesions (BIRADS 5) and subsequent breast cancer diagnosis underwent sequential combined [18F]FDG/[18F]FMISO PET-MRI. [18F]FDG was used to assess increased glycolysis, while [18F]FMISO was used to detect tumor hypoxia. MRI protocol included dynamic breast contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Qualitative and quantitative multiparametric imaging findings were compared with pathological features (grading, proliferation, and receptor status) and clinical endpoints (recurrence/metastases and disease-specific death) using multiple correlation analysis. Histopathology was the standard of reference. There were several intermediate to strong correlations identified between quantitative bioimaging markers, histopathologic tumor characteristics, and clinical endpoints. Based on correlation analysis, multiparametric criteria provided independent information. The prognostic indicators proliferation rate, death, and presence/development of recurrence/metastasis correlated positively, whereas the prognostic indicator estrogen receptor status correlated negatively with PET parameters. The strongest correlations were found between disease-specific death and [18F]FDGmean (R=0.83, p&lt;0.01) and between the presence/development of metastasis and [18F]FDGmax (R=0.79, p&lt;0.01), respectively.

Our objectives were to examine whether hospital characteristics are associated with variation in SLNB positivity rates and whether hospitals with lower-than-expected SLNB positivity rates have worse patient survival. Methods: Using the National Cancer Data Base, stage I to III breast cancer patients were identified (2004-2012). Hospital-level SLNB positivity rates were adjusted for tumor and patient factors. Hospitals were divided into terciles of SLNB positivity rates (lower-, higher-, as-expected). Hospital characteristics and survival were examined across terciles. Results: Of 438 610 SLNB patients (from 1357 hospitals), 78 104 had one or more positive SLN (21.3%). Hospitals in the low and high terciles were more likely to be low volume (low: RRR, 4.40; 95% CI, 2.89-6.57; P < 0.001; and high: RRR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.64; P < 0.001) compared to hospitals with as-expected (middle tercile) SLNB positivity rates. Stage I patients at low- and high-tercile hospitals had statistically worse survival. Conclusions: There is a wide variation in hospital SLNB positivity rates. Hospitals with lower- or higher-than-expected SLNB positivity rates were associated with survival differences.

Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial of 121 breast cancer survivors who were currently receiving AIs and experiencing at least mild arthralgia. QOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Participants were randomized to either a 1-year gym-based, supervised exercise intervention group (150 minutes of aerobic exercise and 2 strength-training sessions each week) or a usual care group. Effects of the intervention on QOL were assessed using mixed-model, repeated-measures analysis. Results: At 12 months, the exercise group had greater improvement in the overall QOL measures as well as the breast cancer-specific (scores, 2.2 vs 0.7; P =.02), endocrine-specific (scores, 5.6 vs 1.6; P <.001), and fatigue-specific (score, 5.8 vs 0.5; P <.001) subscales compared with the usual care group. The results indicated a stronger effect at 12 months versus 6 months after the intervention. Conclusions: Combined aerobic and resistance exercise, such as treadmill walking and strength training, improved endocrine-related and overall QOL among breast cancer survivors who were experiencing adverse side effects from AIs. Because adverse side effects associated with AI use are quite common and this is the main reason for treatment discontinuation, this nonpharmacologic intervention could benefit many breast cancer survivors and increase successful adherence to AIs in breast cancer treatment. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062537936

Lesion size, tumor grade, and tissue prognostic factors were noted. Ipsilateral axillary LNs were evaluated using morphological criteria on CMRI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of suspicious ipsilateral LNs were obtained and compared with ADC values of contralateral benign axillary LNs. Receiver operating characteristic curves and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used using pathology as the gold standard. Results: Eighty-five eligible patients were identified, with surgical pathology revealing 34 patients (40%) who had malignant and 51 (60%) had benign ipsilateral axillae. The sensitivity of CMRI was 79%, with a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 65%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 89%.

Mitigating this burden is critical, and local research is necessary to generate the evidence to inform policy, public health and medical practice. Most of the knowledge available has been derived from studies in high-income countries that are not directly applicable due to economic, social, cultural and ethnic differences. At the time of writing this paper, we had no knowledge of any longitudinal cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa of both breast cancer survivors and a matching cohort of women who have never had a diagnosis of cancer. We aim to assess feasibility of cohort studies in Kenya that consider clinical characteristics social determinants and individual health seeking behaviour. Methods and analysis: This study aims to inform best practices for initiating a longitudinal cohort study in Kenya. It is a two-pronged, prospective mixed methods study of women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer with baseline data collection and one follow-up data collection approximately 3 months later by telephone. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected concurrently, analysed separately and together to enrich understanding of concepts by triangulation. We aim to include 800 women aged 30-60 years: 400 in the survivorship cohort and 400 in the non-cancer cohort. Two focus group discussions from each cohort will be carried out to enhance understanding of concepts and to guide recommendations. Ethics and dissemination: Independent ethical approval was obtained from Kenyatta National Hospital-University of Nairobi Ethics and Research Committee and the Research Triangle Institute International. Only consenting participants will be enrolled. Counselling support, debriefing discussions and referrals for formal support services will be available for both participants and research assistants. Findings will be disseminated through publications, websites and presentations. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060780757

Methods: Eight focus groups occurred with a total of 40 local African American breast cancer survivors. Focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Framework analyses were used to identify themes. NVivo qualitative analysis software-managed data.

However, the extent to which primary care providers (PCPs) are involved in initial treatment decisions remains unknown. Methods: A stratified random sample of PCPs identified by newly diagnosed patients with early-stage breast cancer from the Georgia and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries were surveyed (n = 517; a 61% response rate). PCPs were asked how frequently they discussed surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy options with patients; how comfortable they were with these discussions; whether they had the necessary knowledge to participate in decision making; and what their confidence was in their ability to help (on 5-item Likert-type scales). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify PCP-reported attitudes associated with more PCP participation in each treatment decision. Results: In this sample, 34% of PCPs reported that they discussed surgery, 23% discussed radiation, and 22% discussed chemotherapy options with their patients. Of those who reported more involvement in surgical decisions, 22% reported that they were not comfortable having a discussion, and 17% did not feel that they had the necessary knowledge to participate in treatment decision making. PCPs who positively appraised their ability to participate were more likely to participate in all 3 decisions (odds ratio [OR] for surgery, 6.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.16-8.68; OR for radiation, 8.37; 95% CI, 5.16-13.58; OR for chemotherapy, 6.56; 95% CI, 4.23-10.17).

While tamoxifen significantly increases overall survival, tamoxifen resistance remains a major limitation despite continued expression of ERα in resistant tumors. Previous reports have described increased oxidative stress in tamoxifen resistant versus sensitive breast cancer and a role for PARP1 in mediating oxidative damage repair. We hypothesized that PARP1 activity mediated tamoxifen resistance in ERα-positive breast cancer and that combining the antiestrogen tamoxifenwith a PARP1 inhibitor (PARPi)would sensitize tamoxifen resistant cells to tamoxifen therapy. In tamoxifen-resistant vs. -sensitive breast cancer cells, oxidative stress and PARP1 overexpression were increased. Furthermore, differential PARylation of ERα was observed in tamoxifen-resistant versus -sensitive cells, and ERα PARylation was increased by tamoxifen treatment. Loss of ERα PARylation following treatment with a PARP inhibitor (talazoparib) augmented tamoxifen sensitivity and decreased localization of both ERα and PARP1 to ERα-target genes. Co-administration of talazoparib plus tamoxifen increased DNA damage accumulation and decreased cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of PARPi to overcome tamoxifen resistance was dependent on ERα, as lack of ERα-mediated estrogen signaling expression and showed no response to tamoxifen-PARPi treatment. These results correlate ERα PARylationwith tamoxifen resistance and indicate a novelmechanism-based approach to overcome tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer. © 2019 by the authors.

However, they also secrete anti-cancer mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The purpose of this study was to investigate adipose tissue as a new source of MC in quantities that could be used to study MC biology focusing on their ability to bind to and kill breast cancer cells. We tested several cell culture media previously demonstrated to induce MC differentiation. We report here the generation of functional human MC from adipose tissue. The adipose-derived mast cells (ADMC) are phenotypically and functionally similar to connective tissue expressing tryptase, chymase, c-kit, and FcεRI and capable of degranulating after cross-linking of FcεRI. The ADMC, sensitized with anti-HER2/neu IgE antibodies with human constant regions (trastuzumab IgE and/or C6MH3-B1 IgE), bound to and released MC mediators when incubated with HER2/neu-positive human breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3 and BT-474). Importantly, the HER2/neu IgE-sensitized ADMC induced breast cancer cell (SK-BR-3) death through apoptosis. Breast cancer cell apoptosis was observed after the addition of cell-free supernatants containing mediators released from FcεRI-challenged ADMC.

However, these tools do not reliably identify patients at the greatest risk of recurrence. The mutation and copy-number landscape of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes defined by gene expression is also largely unknown, and elucidation of this landscape may shed light on novel therapeutic opportunities. The USO01062 phase III clinical trial of standard chemotherapy (with or without capecitabine) enrolled a cohort of putatively high-risk patients based on clinical features, yet only observed a 5-year disease-free survival event rate of 11.6%. In order to uncover genomic aberrations associated with recurrence, a targeted next-generation sequencing panel was used to compare tumor specimens from patients who had a recurrence event with a matched set who did not. The somatic mutation and copy-number alteration landscapes of high-risk early breast cancer patients were characterized and alterations associated with relapse were identified. Tumor mutational burden was evaluated but was not prognostic in this study, nor did it correlate with PDL1 or CD8 gene expression. However, TNBC subtypes had substantial genomic heterogeneity with a distinct pattern of genomic alterations and putative underlying driver mutations.

The underlying molecular mechanism of DCIS progression is yet poorly understood, and appropriate biomarkers to distinguish benign form of DCIS from potentially invasive tumor are urgently needed. Methods: To identify the key regulators of DCIS progression, we performed gene-expression analysis of syngeneic breast cancer cell lines MCF10A, DCIS.com, and MCF10CA and cross-referenced the targets with patient cohort data. Results: We identified ID2 as a critical gene for DCIS initiation and found that ID2 promoted DCIS formation by enhancing cancer stemness of pre-malignant cells. ID2 also plays a pivotal role in survival of the aggressive cancer cells. In addition, we identified INHBA and GJB2 as key regulators for the transition of benign DCIS to aggressive phenotype. These two genes regulate migration, colonization, and stemness of invasive cancer cells. Upregulation of ID2 and GJB2 predicts poor prognosis after breast-conserving surgery. Finally, we found a natural compound Helichrysetin as ID2 inhibitor which suppresses DCIS formation in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Our results indicate that ID2 is a key driver of DCIS formation and therefore is considered to be a potential target for prevention of DCIS, while INHBA and GJB2 play vital roles in progression of DCIS to IDC and they may serve as potential prognosis markers. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061288519

Tamoxifen efficacy is thought to be attributable to its active metabolite, which is formed through a reaction catalyzed by the P450 enzyme, CYP2D6. Inhibition of tamoxifen metabolism as a result of germline genetic variation and/or use of CYP2D6-inhibiting medications (“inhibitors”) is hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse BC outcomes among women taking tamoxifen. Methods: The present cohort study of 960 women diagnosed with early-stage BC between 1993 and 1999 examined the association between concomitant use of CYP2D6 inhibitors and adjuvant tamoxifen and the risk of adverse BC outcomes (recurrence, second primary BC, BC mortality), both overall and according to CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype. Results: Six or more months of CYP2D6 inhibitor use concomitant with tamoxifen was not associated with any appreciable increase in risk of recurrence or second primary BC or BC mortality, and there was no clear evidence of variation by CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype.

This study examined neurologic outcomes, tumor control, and survival data in breast cancer patients with multiple brain metastases and who required salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent breast cancer brain metastases. Methods: The study included 231 patients with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer who underwent SRS for more than 1 brain metastases from May 1993 and July 2007. Survival analyses via univariate and multivariate Cox regression demonstrated interactions between survival and predictor values including Karnofsky Performance Scale, Recursive Partitioning Analysis Class, number of brain metastases, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Results: Of the 231 patients, the survival rate was 53% at 1 year and 26% at 5 years from initial SRS. Controlled systemic disease, adjuvant chemotherapy, and Recursive Partitioning Analysis class II were significant predictors of increased survival, while WBRT was a significant predictor of decreased survival. The median survival in patients who received WBRT after SRS was 11 months versus 23 months in those who did not. The local tumor control rate at initial follow-up was 95%. Of these, 40% of patients underwent additional brain SRS. Following salvage SRS, 8% of patients developed symptomatic adverse radiation events; however, the development of symptomatic adverse radiation events had no effect on patient survival. Conclusions: This report indicated that both initial and salvage SRS procedures in breast cancer patients with multiple brain metastases are effective for local control of intracranial disease while minimizing adverse radiation effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061998799

The purpose of this study was to evaluate peak VO2 and right (RV) and left (LV) ventricular function prior to adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-nine early-stage breast cancer patients (mean age: 48 years) and 10 age-matched healthy women were studied. Participants performed an upright cycle exercise test with expired gas analysis to measure peak VO2. RV and LV volumes and function were measured at rest, submaximal and peak supine cycle exercise using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Peak VO2 was significantly lower in breast cancer patients versus controls (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 2.3 ± 0.5 L/min, P = 0.0013; 25 ± 6 vs. 35 ± 6 mL/kg/min, P = 0.00009).

No significant difference was found between groups for rest and exercise RV and LV ejection fraction. Despite preserved RV and LV ejection fraction, the decreased peak VO2 in early-stage breast cancer patients prior to adjuvant chemotherapy is due in part to decreased peak cardiac index secondary to reductions in RV and LV end-diastolic volumes. © 2019 The Authors.

Yet, how oncogenic TAZ regulates cell-cycle progression and proliferation in breast cancer remains poorly understood, and whether TAZ is required for tumor maintenance has not been established. Here, using an integrative oncogenomic approach, TAZ-dependent cellular programs essential for tumor growth and progression were identified. Significantly, TAZ-driven tumor cells required sustained TAZ expression, given that its withdrawal impaired both genesis and maintenance of solid tumors. Moreover, temporal inhibition of TAZ diminished the metastatic burden in established macroscopic pulmonary metastases. Mechanistic investigation revealed that TAZ controls distinct gene profiles that determine cancer cell fate through cell-cycle networks, including a specific, causal role for S-phase kinase–associated protein 2 (SKP2) in mediating the neoplastic state. Together, this study elucidates the molecular events that underpin the role of TAZ in BLBC and link to SKP2, a convergent communication node for multiple cancer signaling pathways, as a key downstream effector molecule. Implications: Understanding the molecular role of TAZ and its link to SKP2, a signaling convergent point and key regulator in BLBC, represents an important step toward the identification of novel therapeutic targets for TAZ-dependent breast cancer. 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059498741

Herein, the authors define the frequency, immunohistochemical correlates, and other clinicopathological features of breast cancers with HER2/CEP17 ratio of 2 or greater and HER2/neu copy number less than 4 (group A), based on an analysis of an institutional cohort assessed for HER2/neu status by both florescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry and scored using 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria.

Design: This is a retrospective review of a clinical program from January 2016 to July 2017. Settings/Location: It includes seven 2-h group medical visits held every other week at an outpatient wellness facility. Subjects: Eligible participants are breast cancer survivors who have completed treatment, including those who remain on hormonal therapy. Intervention: Patients receive education and experience in nutrition, culinary medicine, physical activity, and stress relief practices. Outcome measures: Participants' weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass, lean body mass, and percent body fat were measured at visit 1 and visit 7. Standard validated questionnaires were used to measure perceived stress, depression, patient activation, physical and mental quality of life, dietary fat consumption, and dietary fruit, vegetable, and fiber consumption. Results: A total of 31 patients participated in the group visits. Pre-post comparison data were not available for 10 patients. More than three-quarters of the 21 breast cancer survivors who attended 5 or more of the 7 group visits and provided data at the first and the last group visit decreased their body weight. On average, patients lost 4.9 pounds (-2.6%, p &lt; 0.01), and their BMI decreased by 0.8 kg/m2 (-2.5%, p &lt; 0.01). Changes in psychosocial variables of perceived stress, depression, patient activation, and quality of life trended in a positive direction, but did not reach statistical significance. Patients reported a significant decrease in average weekly fat consumption (-31.5%, p &lt; 0.01). Most patients found the program educational and enjoyable, and nearly half of them described it as life changing.

TNBCs express extremely low levels of the miR-200 family compared with estrogen receptor–positive (ER þ ) breast cancer. In normal epithelial cells and ER þ breast cancers and cell lines, high levels of the family member miR-200c serve to target and repress genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To identify mechanism(s) that permit TNBC to express TDO2 and other proteins not expressed in the more well-differentiated ER þ breast cancers, miRNA-200c was restored in TNBC cell lines. The data demonstrate that miR-200c targeted TDO2 directly resulting in reduced production of the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine. Furthermore, in addition to reversing a classic EMT signature, miR-200c repressed many genes encoding immunosuppressive factors including CD274/CD273, HMOX-1, and GDF15. Restoration of miR-200c revealed a mechanism, whereby TNBC hijacks a gene expression program reminiscent of that used by trophoblasts to suppress the maternal immune system to ensure fetal tolerance during pregnancy.

In the NSABP B-42 study, we aimed to determine whether extended letrozole treatment improves disease-free survival after 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy in women with postmenopausal breast cancer. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done in 158 centres in the USA, Canada, and Ireland. Postmenopausal women with stage I–IIIA hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who were disease-free after about 5 years of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 years of letrozole (2·5 mg orally per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by pathological node status, previous tamoxifen use, and lowest bone mineral density T score in the lumbosacral spine, total hip, or femoral neck. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as time from randomisation to breast cancer recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death, and was analysed by intention to treat. To adjust for previous interim analyses, the two-sided statistical significance level for disease-free survival was set at 0·0418. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00382070, is active, and is no longer enrolling patients. Findings: Between Sept 28, 2006, and Jan 6, 2010, 3966 patients were randomly assigned to receive letrozole (n=1983) or placebo (n=1983). Follow-up information was available for 3903 patients for the analyses of disease-free survival. Median follow-up was 6·9 years (IQR 6·1–7·5). Letrozole treatment did not significantly improve disease-free survival (339 disease-free survival events were reported in the placebo group and 292 disease-free survival events were reported in the letrozole group; hazard ratio 0·85, 95% CI 0·73–0·999; p=0·048). 7-year disease-free survival estimate was 81·3% (95% CI 79·3–83·1) in the placebo group and 84·7% (82·9–86·4) in the letrozole group. The most common grade 3 adverse events were arthralgia (47 [2%] of 1933 patients in the placebo group vs 50 [3%] of 1941 patients in the letrozole group) and back pain (44 [2%] vs 38 [2%]). The most common grade 4 adverse event in the placebo group was thromboembolic event (eight [<1%]) and the most common grade 4 adverse events in the letrozole group were urinary tract infection, hypokalaemia, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (four [<1%] each). Interpretation: After 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy, 5 years of letrozole therapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival compared with placebo.

Purpose: To noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intra- and peritumoral radiomics features combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor. Study Type: Retrospective. Population: A total of 163 breast cancer patients (55 positive SLN and 108 negative SLN). Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T, T 1 -weighted DCE-MRI. Assessment: A total of 590 radiomic features were extracted for each patient from both intratumoral and peritumoral regions of interest. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was randomly separated into a training set (∼67%) and a validation set (∼33%). The prediction models were built with the training set using logistic regression on the most significant radiomic features in the training set combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics. The prediction performance was further evaluated in the independent validation set. Statistical Tests: Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed. Results: Combining radiomic features with clinicopathologic characteristics, six features were automatically selected in the training set to establish the prediction model of SLN metastasis. In the independent validation set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869 (NPV = 0.886). Using radiomic features alone in the same procedure, 4 features were selected and the validation set AUC was 0.806 (NPV = 0.824). Data Conclusion: This is the first attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE-MRI radiomics to predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics improved the prediction performance. This study provides noninvasive methods to evaluate SLN status for guiding further treatment of breast cancer patients, and can potentially benefit those with negative SLN, by eliminating unnecessary invasive lymph node removal and the associated complications, which is a step further towards precision medicine.

However, image quality and therefore ability to accurately measure strain are often limited in this patient group because of tissue expanders, implants, and/or flap reconstruction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of measuring left ventricular longitudinal strain (LVLS) in the echocardiographic subcostal view in female patients with breast cancer. Methods: A total of 110 studies from 68 female patients with breast cancer were included. The feasibility of LVLS speckle-tracking measurements in the apical three-chamber (3C) and four-chamber (4C) views and in the subcostal 3C and 4C views was evaluated. The LVLS speckle-tracking measurements obtained in these two echocardiographic views were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses. Results: The feasibility of LVLS in the apical 3C and 4C views was 98.1% and 98.1%, respectively. In comparison, the feasibility of LVLS in the subcostal 3C and 4C views was 93.6% and 96.3%, respectively. A high degree of reliability was found between apical and subcostal LVLS 3C and 4C measurements. For the 3C view, the average measure intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72–0.88). For the 4C view, the average measure intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70–0.87). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between apical and subcostal measurements in both the 3C and 4C views. Conclusions: Subcostal 3C and 4C LVLS can be reliably measured, with good agreement with conventional LVLS from the apical views, in female patients with breast cancer. Importantly, the subcostal view may provide a novel alternative for trending LVLS in patients with breast cancer who have technically limited apical windows. © 2018 American Society of Echocardiography","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061033042

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between self-reported health literacy and 1) decision to take adjuvant endocrine therapy and 2) adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy at 2 years among women with breast cancer. Methods: We initiated a prospective health literacy assessment to determine the relationship between health literacy and breast health outcomes. Among our overall cohort, we determined women who had estrogen receptor positive (ER+) disease and were recommended to take adjuvant endocrine therapy, those who initiated treatment, and those adherent at 2 years following diagnosis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were calculated to determine the relationship between health literacy and both initiation and adherence. Results: Among the 340 patients in the sample who were recommended to take adjuvant endocrine therapy, 296 (87.1%) initiated the therapy. Two-year follow-up data are available in 136 patients with ER+ tumors. Among the patients with 2-year longitudinal data available, 108 (79.4%) were adherent and still taking the endocrine therapy at 2 years following diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analysis, there was no statistical significance between health literacy and initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy or adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy at 2 years. Conclusion: Despite the underpinnings regarding health literacy and medication adherence supporting our hypothesis, we did not find an association between health literacy and the decision to initiate therapy or continued adherence at 2 years following diagnosis.

Objective: To assess DFS and OS for patients treated with sequential vs concurrent anthracycline plus trastuzumab. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted at 36 centers in the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Women 18 years or older with invasive operable HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled from September 15, 2007, to December 15, 2011, and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. The analysis data set was locked on October 15, 2017, and analysis was completed on December 15, 2017. Interventions: Patients randomized to arm 1 received 500 mg/m 2 of fluorouracil, 75 mg/m 2 of epirubicin, and 500 mg/m 2 of cyclophosphamide (FEC) every 3 weeks for 12 weeks followed by the combination of 80 mg/m 2 of paclitaxel and 2 mg/kg (except initial dose of 4 mg/kg) of trastuzumab weekly for 12 weeks. Patients randomized to arm 2 received the same combination of paclitaxel with trastuzumab weekly for 12 weeks followed by FEC every 3 weeks with weekly trastuzumab for 12 weeks. Women with hormone receptor-positive disease received endocrine therapy, and radiotherapy was delivered at physician discretion. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were DFS and OS and pCR in the breast and nodes. Results: Two hundred eighty-two women with HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled in the trial, and 2 withdrew consent before treatment. Among the remaining 280 women, the median age was 50 years (range, 28-76 years), 232 (82.9%) were white, 29 (10.3%) were black, 8 (2.9%) were Asian, 4 (1.4%) were American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 7 (2.5%) did not report race/ethnicity. There were 22 disease events in arm 1 and 27 in arm 2. Disease-free survival rates did not differ with respect to treatment arm (stratified log-rank P =.96; stratified hazard ratio [HR] [arm 2 to arm 1], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.56-1.83). Overall survival did not differ with respect to treatment arm (stratified log-rank P =.73; stratified HR [arm 2 to arm 1], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.48-2.88). Conclusions and Relevance: Across a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 26 days to 6.2 years), pCR, DFS, and OS did not differ with respect to sequential or concurrent administration of FEC with trastuzumab.

Better understanding of patient conceptions of risk would facilitate doctor–patient communication and surgical decision making. In this mixed methods study, we prospectively examined breast cancer patients’ perceived risk of future cancer and the reported factors that drove their risk perceptions. Methods: Women age 21–60 diagnosed with breast cancer without a BRCA mutation or known distant metastases completed a study interview between surgical consult and surgical treatment. Participants completed a 12-item Perceived Risk Questionnaire, which assessed 10-year and lifetime risks of ipsilateral local recurrence, CBC, and distant recurrence. Patients provided qualitative explanations for their answers. Results: Sixty-three patients completed study interviews (mean age 50.3). Participants were primarily White (85.7%) and 90.5% had attended college. Patients estimated their 10-year risk of CBC as 22.0%, nearly 4 times the established 10-year risk. Women attributed their risk perceptions to “gut feelings” about future cancer, even when women knew those feelings contradicted medically established risk. Perceptions of risk also reflected beliefs that cancer is random and that risk for local recurrence, CBC, and distant recurrence are the same. Conclusions: Our findings point to the need for novel ways of presenting factual information regarding both risk of recurrence and of new primary cancers, as well as the necessity of acknowledging cognitive and affective processes many patients use when conceptualizing risk. By differentiating women’s intuitive feelings about risk from their knowledge of medically estimated risk, doctors can enhance informed decision making. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062781720

Breast cancer survivors meeting NCCN genetic counseling referral criteria completed questionnaires capturing demographic and clinical information and factors guided by the HBM, including health beliefs, psychosocial variables, and cues to action. Using logistic regression, we examined whether the above variables differed based on readiness group (pre-contemplators, who did not plan to make a genetic counseling appointment, and contemplators, who planned to make a genetic counseling appointment in the next 1-6 months). Of 111 participants, 57% were pre-contemplators and 43% were contemplators. Higher cancer worry was associated with increased odds of being a contemplator (OR = 2.99; 95% CI = 1.37-6.54) and higher perceived barriers to genetic counseling were associated with decreased odds of being a contemplator (OR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.11-0.85).

In this report, we demonstrate a sensitive, flow-cytometry-based assay for rapidly assessing the metabolic phenotypes in isolated suspensions of breast cancer cells. By measuring the temporal variation of NAD(p)H signals in unlabeled, living cancer cells, and by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential {Δψ m } in fluorescently labeled cells, we demonstrate that these signals can reliably distinguish the metabolic phenotype of human breast cancer cells and can track the cellular sensitivity to drug candidates. We further show the utility of this metabolic ratio {Δψ m /NAD(p)H} in monitoring mitochondrial functional improvement as well as metabolic heterogeneity in primary murine tumor cells isolated from tumor biopsies.

Western blotting of 4T1 cells demonstrated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) characteristics and overexpression of MCT1 and CD147 (a MCT1 accessory protein), but absence of MCT4 expression. AR-C155858 inhibited the cellular l-lactate uptake and cellular proliferation at low nanomolar potencies (IC 50 values of 25.0 ± 4.2 and 20.2 ± 0.2 nM, respectively). In the xenograft 4T1 mouse model of immunocompetent animals, AR-C155858 (10 mg/kg i.p. once daily) had no effect on tumor volume and weight.

We sought to determine the roles of FGFR1α and FGFR1β variants in breast cancer. TCGA samples and cell lines were analyzed for FGFR1α/FGFR1β expression. MCF-10A cells were used to overexpress these variants. Cell growth and transformation were assessed by SRB, colony formation, 3D-Matrigel, soft agar, cell motility assays. In TCGA, compared to FGFR1 non-amplified samples, FGFR1-amplified samples had significantly higher FGFR1α but not FGFR1β levels. FGFR1β expression levels and FGFR1β/FGFR1α ratio were higher in basal subtype samples than in ER-positive/luminal samples in both TCGA and breast cancer cell lines. Both FGFR1α and FGFR1β induced transformation of MCF-10A cells. However, only FGFR1β-expressing cells, not FGFR1α, enhanced cell growth and cell motility. Cells with higher FGFR1β levels and FGFR1β/FGFR1α ratio were more sensitive to FGFR inhibitor BGJ-398. Interestingly, in ER-negative cells, FGFR inhibitors decreased FGFR1β levels, likely by increasing expression of splicing repressor PTBP1. In ER-positive cells, estrogen treatment increased FGFR1β levels by decreasing PTBP1 expression, which was blocked by 4-OHT. Lastly, combination treatment with BGJ-398 and 4-OHT synergistically inhibited cell survival.

The purpose of this study was to compare the 7th and 8th edition of AJCC staging system for prognostic impact. Materials and methods: Primary breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2014 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 18 registries research database. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) between stages were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to identify factors independently associated with outcome. Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) was calculated to estimate how well the staging system fitted the data and the complexity of the model. Results: A total of 184,221 primary breast cancer patients were identified in the 7th AJCC staging system; 16,145 (8.8%) patients could not be categorized according to 8th AJCC prognostic staging system leaving 168,076 patients included for final analyses.

We used the population-based Australian Breast Cancer Family Study which followed-up 1,196 women enrolled during 1992–1999 when aged <60 years at diagnosis with a first primary invasive breast cancer, over-sampled for younger ages at diagnosis, for whom tumor pathology features and ER status were measured. There were 375 deaths (median follow-up = 15.7; range = 0.8–21.4, years). We estimated the mortality hazard as a function of time since diagnosis using a flexible parametric survival analysis with ER status a time-dependent covariate. For women with ER-negative tumors compared with those with ER-positive tumors, 5-year mortality was initially higher (p < 0.001), similar if they survived to 5 years (p = 0.4), and lower if they survived to 10 years (p = 0.02). The estimated mortality hazard for ER-negative disease peaked at ~3 years post-diagnosis, thereafter declined with time, and at 7 years post-diagnosis became lower than that for ER-positive disease. This pattern was more pronounced for women diagnosed at younger ages. Mortality was also associated with lymph node count (hazard ratio (HR) per 10 nodes = 2.52 [95% CI:2.11–3.01]) and tumor grade (HR per grade = 1.62 [95% CI:1.34–1.96]). The risk of death following a breast cancer diagnosis differs substantially and qualitatively with diagnosis age, ER status and time survived. For women who survive >7 years, those with ER-negative disease will on average live longer, and more so if younger at diagnosis. © 2019 UICC","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062569555

This study was undertaken to determine how SI lesions are treated in the United States and to discern the benefit of systemic therapy. Patients and Methods: Data of patients diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer in the National Cancer Data Base between 2004 and 2011 were reviewed. Treatment patterns were examined and overall survival assessed. Results: A total of 3485 patients had SI and 456,287 patients had non-SI breast cancers. Chemotherapy was administered to 68.5% of SI and 45.9% of non-SI tumors (P <.001), including 77.2% of SI and 33% of non-SI tumors < 2 cm (P <.001). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, SI patients were 19.4% more likely to receive chemotherapy than non-SI patients. Radiotherapy was provided to 61.1% of SI and 64.3% of non-SI tumors (P <.001), including 65.5% of SI and 66.5% non-SI tumors < 2 cm (P =.711). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, SI patients were 76.6% more likely to receive radiotherapy than non-SI patients. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy provided an overall survival benefit for stage II and III SI and non-SI tumors. Conclusion: Despite controversy regarding staging and prognosis of SI tumors, the majority of patients are provided systemic therapy and radiotherapy. Varied patterns of chemotherapy administration for SI tumors suggests that further treatment guidance and standardization are required, especially because chemotherapy and radiotherapy are equally efficacious in SI and non-SI tumors alike. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062624639

Despite the lack of clinical evidence, obtaining prechemotherapy left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan is a widely adopted practice throughout the world. We present here the results of a retrospective analysis of breast cancer patients who had LVEF measurements in anticipation of an anthracycline chemotherapy to determine whether predefined cardiac risk factors predicted for poor cardiac function. Retrospective data were analyzed from 482 female breast cancer patients in whom LVEF was measured before starting anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Baseline demographics and multiple risk factors associated with congestive heart failure were collected. Twenty-six possible risk factors for CHF were defined, and the frequency of finding an abnormal LVEF as a function of total risk factors was assessed. Statistical tests include chi-squared and logistic regression analysis. The median age of the study population was 52 years. The original chemotherapy plan was changed in 7 patients (1.45%) based on LVEF findings, all of which had asymptomatic LV dysfunction (LVEF ranging 40%-50%). In 32 patients, despite normal LVEF results, anthracyclines were omitted secondary to prior cardiac issues. In 17 patients where LVEF was reported normal, anthracyclines were skipped based on patient's preference, tumor characteristics, or upstaging of the cancer based on imaging studies. No patient with ≤2 risk factors had an abnormal LVEF (N = 350). The probability of finding an abnormal LVEF in patients without any cardiac risk factors is extremely rare. Skipping baseline LVEF assessment may be an option in some patients with no cardiac risk factors undergoing anthracycline-based chemotherapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059204308

Objective: The aims of this study were to elucidate what constitutes an explanatory model of risk and to describe explanatory models of risk related to developing breast cancer. Methods: Thirty qualitative interviews with women identified as at an increased risk for breast cancer were conducted. Interviews were coded to identify domains of explanatory models of risk using a priori codes derived from the explanatory model of illness framework. Within each domain, a grounded thematic analysis described participants' explanatory models related to breast cancer risk. Results: The domains of treatment and etiology remained similar in a risk context compared with illness, whereas course of illness, symptoms, and pathophysiology differed. We identified a new, integrative concept relative to other domains within explanatory models of risk: social comparisons, which was dominant in risk perhaps due to the lack of physical experiences associated with being ""at risk."" Conclusions: Developing inclusive understandings of risk and its treatment is key to developing a framework for the care of high-risk patients that is both evidence based and sensitive to patient preferences. Implications for Practice: The concept of ""social comparisons"" can assist healthcare providers in understanding women's decision making under conditions of risk. Ensuring that healthcare providers understand patient perceptions of risk is important because it relates to patient decision making, particularly due to an increasing focus on risk assessment in cancer. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: To study the mechanisms underlying the lncRNA’s connection to breast cancer, we investigated the molecular targets and regulation of LINC00472 in breast cancer cells, and analyzed relevant molecular features in relation to patient survival. Gene expression profiles of breast cancer cells overexpressing LINC00472 were analyzed for its regulatory pathways and downstream targets. Effects of LINC00472 overexpression on cell behaviors were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Meta-analysis was performed using online datasets and our own study. Results: Analysis of LINC00472 transcriptome revealed ERα upregulation of LINC00472 expression, and an ERα-binding site in the LINC00472 promoter was identified. Evaluation of LINC00472 overexpression also indicated a possible link between LINC00472 and NF-κB. Cell experiments confirmed that LINC00472 suppressed the phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα through binding to IKKβ, inhibiting its phosphorylation. High LINC00472 expression inhibited tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and suppressed aggressive tumor cell behaviors in vitro. Suppressing LINC00472 expression in ER-positive tumor cells increased cell aggressive behaviors. Tamoxifen treatment of ER-positive cells inhibited ERα and LINC00472 expression and increased p65 and IκBα phosphorylation. Meta-analysis showed that LINC00472 expression were higher in ER-positive than ER-negative tumors and that high expression was associated with better disease outcomes in ER-positive patients. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that ERα upregulates LINC00472 which suppresses the phosphorylation of NF-κB, and suggests that endocrine treatment may lower LINC00472 and increase NF-κB activities, leading to tumor progression and disease recurrence. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062664472

CSF-1R is an important mediator of breast cancer development, metastasis, and survival. We confirm that vigilin decreases in vitro reporter luciferase activity as well as the translation rate of target mRNAs. We further explore the mechanism of suppression of CSF-1R. We show that the 69 nt binding element has profound effects on translation efficiency of CSF-1R mRNA, not seen in the presence of mutation of the element. Also, mutation of the 69 nt element in the CSF-1R mRNA 3′UTR both interferes with direct vigilin binding and obviates effect of vigilin overexpression on translational repression of CSF-1R. We show that stable vigilin binding requires the full length 69 nt CSF-1R element, including the 26 nt pyrimidine-rich core. Furthermore, titration of endogenous vigilin and other proteins which bind the 69 nt element, by exogenously introduced CSF-1R mRNA 3′UTR containing the pyrimidine-rich sequence, increases the adhesion, motility, and invasion of breast cancer cells. This phenotypic effect is not seen when the 69 nt element is deleted. Lastly, we are the first to show that human breast tissues exhibit strong vigilin expression in normal breast epithelium. Our pilot data suggest decreased vigilin protein expression, along with shift from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic location, in the transition to ductal carcinoma in situ. © 2018","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85054164333

Methods: Sites were randomized 1:1 to the YWI or a contact time control physical activity intervention (PAI) stratified by academic or community site. Up to 15 women aged ≤45 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer were enrolled at each of 14 academic sites and 10 were enrolled at each of 40 community sites. The primary endpoint, attention to fertility, was ascertained by medical record review. Statistical inferences concerning the effect of the intervention used general estimating equations for clustered data. Results: A total of 467 patients across 54 sites were enrolled between July 2012 and December 2013. The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 40 years (range, 22-45 years). Attention to fertility by 3 months was observed in 55% of patients in the YWI and 58% of patients in the PAI (P =.88). Rates were found to be strongly correlated with age (P <.0001), and were highest in patients aged <30 years. Attention to genetics was similar (80% in the YWI and 81% in the PAI), whereas attention to emotional health was higher in patients in the YWI (87% vs 76%; estimated odds ratio, 2.63 [95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.76; P =.016]). Patients rated both interventions as valuable in providing education (64% in the YWI and 63% in the PAI). Conclusions: The current study failed to demonstrate differences in attention to fertility with an intervention to improve care for women with breast cancer, although attention to fertility was found to be higher than expected in both groups and emotional health was improved in the YWI group. Greater attention to young women with breast cancer in general may promote more comprehensive care for this population. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85060878351

Methods and Materials: Carbon fiducials were placed intraoperatively in the periphery of the lumpectomy cavity. Nine patients received whole breast irradiation with a boost, and 2 patients received 3-dimensional conformal partial breast irradiation. A total of 89 fractions were assessed for setup errors relative to a predefined gold standard, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) match to the lumpectomy cavity, using the following 4 setup methods: (1) Align skin tattoos with lasers; (2) match bone with 2-dimensional–2-dimensional (2D/2D) kV onboard imaging (OBI); (3) match the whole breast with CBCT; and (4) match carbon fiducials with 2D/2D kV OBI. The margin for the planning target volume (PTV) was calculated by 2 standard deviations of the setup errors, and compared among the 4 setup methods. Setup errors for patients treated with free breathing and patients with deep inspiration breath hold were also compared. Results: The carbon fiducials were sufficiently visible on OBI for matching and introduced minimal artifacts. Of the 4 alignment methods, 2D/2D OBI match to fiducials resulted in the smallest setup errors. The PTV margin was 12 mm for aligning skin tattoos using lasers, 9.2 mm for matching bone on OBI, 6.5 mm for matching breast on CBCT, and 3.5 mm for matching fiducials on 2D/2D OBI. Compared with free breathing, deep inspiration breath hold generally reduced the standard deviations of the setup errors, but further investigation would be needed. Conclusions: Matching to carbon fiducials increased the localization accuracy to the lumpectomy cavity.

Immune infiltration is the most consistent predictive marker for chemotherapy response and improved prognosis in TNBC. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the immune microenvironment differs between AA and Caucasian patients. Methods: RNA-seq expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for 162 AA and 697 Caucasian breast cancers. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive, and TNBC subtypes were included in the analyses. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts, immunomodulatory scores, and molecular subtypes were obtained from prior publications for a subset of the TNBC cases. Differences in immune cell distributions and immune functions, measured through gene expression and TIL counts, as well as neoantigen, somatic mutation, amplification, and deletion loads, were compared by race and tumor subtype. Results: Immune metagene analysis demonstrated marginal immune attenuation in AA TNBC relative to Caucasian TNBC that did not reach statistical significance. The distributions of immune cell populations, lymphocyte infiltration, molecular subtypes, and genomic aberrations between AA and Caucasian subtypes were also not significantly different. The MHC1 metagene demonstrated increased expression in AA ER-positive cancers relative to Caucasian ER-positive cancers. Conclusions: This study suggests that the immunological differences between AA and Caucasian breast cancers represented by TCGA data are subtle, if they exist at all. We observed no consistent racial differences in immune gene expression or TIL counts in TNBC by race.

Methods: Eighty-six women treated for a primary, non-metastatic breast cancer and their partners completed measures of quality of life, relational mutuality, and dyadic coping. Demographic and clinical factors were self-reported. The relationship between mutuality and dyadic coping was evaluated using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). Results: Relational mutuality was positively associated with both the patients’ and the caregivers’ scores on common and positive dyadic coping.

BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 1 year; blood was drawn for skeletal markers. Change from baseline to end of study was compared within and between treatment groups using paired and unpaired t-tests. Results: Lumbar spine BMD declined in both treatment groups with no significant difference between treatment groups (-0.008 ± 0.003 g/cm 2 exercise vs. -0.014 ± 0.003 g/cm 2 control, p = 0.24). However, among the women who did not lose lean mass during the study (n = 100, 54 control, 46 exercise), the exercise intervention prevented lumbar spine bone loss (0.001 ± 0.005 g/cm 2 treatment group vs. -0.014 ± 0.005 g/cm 2 control group, p = 0.03). Bone turnover markers decreased significantly in both groups with no differences between groups. Conclusions: Among women who maintained lean mass, our exercise intervention prevented bone loss; however, our intervention did not prevent bone loss among women who lost muscle mass. Additional investigation into exercise regimens that can prevent both bone and muscle loss may help prevent long-term consequences of premenopausal breast cancer treatment. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059828302

Inflammatory signaling in cancer emerges from the combinatorial interaction of several deregulated pathways. Pathway deregulation is often driven by changes in the underlying gene regulatory networks. Confronted with such complex scenario, it can be argued that a closer analysis of the structure of such regulatory networks will shed some light on how gene deregulation led to sustained inflammation in cancer. Here, we inferred an inflammation-associated gene regulatory network from 641 breast cancer and 78 healthy samples. A modular structure analysis of the regulatory network was carried out, revealing a hierarchical modular structure. Modules show significant overrepresentation score p-values for biological processes unveiling a definite association between inflammatory processes and adaptive immunity. Other modules are enriched for T-cell activation, differentiation of CD8+ lymphocytes and immune cell migration, thus reinforcing the aforementioned association. These analyses suggest that in breast cancer tumors, the balance between antitumor response and immune tolerance involving CD8+ T cells is tipped in favor of the tumor. One possible mechanism is the induction of tolerance and anergization of these cells by persistent antigen exposure.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061606176

Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results–Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) linkage. Inclusion criteria were age >65 years at cancer diagnosis, first primary female breast or prostate cancer, cancer staging information available, completion of baseline MHOS during years 2–3 and follow-up MHOS during years 4–5 post-diagnosis, and falls information available. Data from 437 breast and 660 prostate cancer survivors were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was constructed to evaluate variables from baseline MHOS with relation to falls from follow-up MHOS. Model accuracy was assessed using area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Results: At follow-up MHOS, 26% of breast and 22% of prostate cancer survivors reported falls in the past 12 months. In breast cancer, a history of falls (odds ratio (OR) = 4.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.44–10.04) and sensory impairment in feet (OR = 3.33, 95%CI = 1.51–7.32) were significant predictors of falls. In prostate cancer, a history of falls (OR = 3.04, 95%CI = 1.79–5.15), unmarried (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.12–2.95), lower physical summary score of quality-of-life(OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.94–0.98), urinary incontinence (OR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.08–2.65), older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.01–1.09), and shorter time post-diagnosis (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.93–0.99) were significant predictors of falls. AUC was 0.67 and 0.77 for breast and prostate cancer, respectively, indicating moderate accuracy of models in detecting fallers. Conclusions: Asking older breast and prostate cancer survivors about falls in the past 12 months is imperative in fall prevention.

Guidelines recommend holding HER2-targeted therapies until resolution of cardiac dysfunction. SAFE-HEaRt is the first trial that prospectively tests whether these therapies can be safely administered without interruptions in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Methods: Patients with stage I–IV HER2-positive breast cancer candidates for trastuzumab, pertuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1), with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40–49% and no symptoms of heart failure (HF) were enrolled. All patients underwent cardiology visits, serial echocardiograms and received beta blockers and ACE inhibitors unless contraindicated. The primary endpoint was completion of the planned HER2-targeted therapies without developing either a cardiac event (CE) defined as HF, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia or cardiac death or significant asymptomatic worsening of LVEF. The study was considered successful if planned oncology therapy completion rate was at least 30%. Results: Of 31 enrolled patients, 30 were evaluable. Fifteen patients were treated with trastuzumab, 14 with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and 2 with TDM-1. Mean LVEF was 45% at baseline and 46% at the end of treatment. Twenty-seven patients (90%) completed the planned HER2-targeted therapies. Two patients experienced a CE and 1 had an asymptomatic worsening of LVEF to ≤ 35%. Conclusion: This study provides safety data of HER2-targeted therapies in patients with breast cancer and reduced LVEF while receiving cardioprotective medications and close cardiac monitoring. Our results demonstrate the importance of collaboration between cardiology and oncology providers to allow for delivery of optimal oncologic care to this unique population. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article in Press",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062771168

However, an economic evaluation of these newer therapies is currently lacking. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PAL or RIB for the treatment of advanced HR+, HER2− breast cancer in the United States. Methods: A Markov simulation model was constructed using data from published clinical trials evaluating PAL and RIB. Three simulated treatment strategies included PAL + LET, RIB + LET, or LET alone. The main outcome measures were simulated progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Simulated median OS was 38.9 months for PAL + LET and 33.0 months for LET alone. Simulated median OS for RIB + LET was 43.3 months. Compared to LET alone, PAL + LET provided an additional 0.48 QALYs, on average, with an ICER of $634,000 per QALY gained; RIB + LET provided an additional 0.86 QALYs, on average, with an ICER of $440,000 per QALY gained. At current prices, neither PAL nor RIB was cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. To reach such a cost-effectiveness threshold, PAL and RIB prices must decrease by approximately 70%. Conclusion: Despite significant gains in progression-free survival over letrozole alone, the addition of palbociclib or ribociclib in the treatment of advanced HR+, HER2− breast cancer is not cost-effective in the United States given current drug prices. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062666314

We aimed to compare AIs and tamoxifen with regard to cardiovascular events among older breast cancer patients outside of clinical trials. We hypothesized that AIs increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Methods: We identified women age ≥67 years diagnosed with breast cancer from June 30, 2006 to June 1, 2008 in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER)-Medicare database, treated with either tamoxifen or an AI, and followed through December 31, 2012. To compare myocardial infarction (MI) risk for the treatment groups of AIs vs tamoxifen, we developed and assigned stabilized probability of treatment weights and used the Fine and Gray model for time to MI with death not related to MI as a competing risk. Results: Of the cohort of 5648 women, 4690 were treated with AIs and 958 with tamoxifen; a total of 251 patients developed MI, and 22 patients died of MI during the study period while 476 died of other causes. The hazard for MI was not significantly different between AI vs tamoxifen groups (HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.72-1.42), after adjusting for the following known MI risk factors at the start of adjuvant therapy: diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, MI, and peripheral vascular disease. Conclusions: In this SEER-Medicare-based population study, there were no significant differences in the risk of MI between AI and tamoxifen users after adjustment for known risk factors. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85058116490

Earlier diagnosis generally permits less disruptive treatment, but it is possible that even the diagnosis of a very small breast cancer could significantly adversely impact health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older women. Methods: The authors compared changes in HRQOL measured by either the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) or the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey (VR-12) between 198 women diagnosed with in situ or invasive breast cancer measuring ≤1 cm and 36,814 matched controls using the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry linked with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey. Results: The mean age of the cases and controls was 75 years. The SF-36/VR-12 physical component score 12 was found to decrease by 1.6 points between the baseline and follow-up surveys for the controls compared with 3.2 points for women diagnosed with small breast cancers (P =.016). A 2-point decline is recognized as the minimally significant difference for this measure. On multivariable analysis, diagnosis of a small breast cancer was found to be one of the strongest predictors of a significant decrease in both the physical and mental domains of HRQOL (P =.012 and P =.023, respectively). Conclusions: Receiving the diagnosis of even a very small breast cancer significantly impacts the physical and mental domains of HRQOL in older women.

The authors estimated children’s deaths in association with mothers’ deaths from breast or cervical cancer, 2 common cancers in low-income and middle-income countries affecting women of reproductive age, to develop a comprehensive assessment of the death burden of these cancers. Methods: A Monte Carlo simulation model was devised whereby women were at risk of dying from breast cancer, cervical cancer, or another cause. Compared with children who have living mothers, children of women who die before they reached age 10 years have an elevated risk of death from all causes. Therefore, simulations were conducted, and the impact of mothers’ deaths from cervical and breast cancer on associated child mortality was quantified for Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Denmark (benchmark analysis), then the analyses were extended to all African countries. Results: Benchmark estimates of child deaths associated with mothers’ deaths from breast and cervical cancer resulted in an increment in cancer-related mortality of approximately 2% in Bangladesh, 14% in Burkina Faso, and less than 1% in Denmark. The model predicted an increment in comprehensive cancer deaths when including child death estimates by as high as 30% in certain African countries. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the impact of a mother’s death from cancer on child mortality.

Subjects: In all, 107 patients with invasive breast cancer met the inclusion criteria (mean age 57 years, range 32–87) and underwent multiparametric breast MRI. Field Strength/Sequence: 3 T, readout-segmented echo planar imaging (rsEPI) with IR fat suppression, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) T 1 -weighted imaging, T 2 -weighted turbo-spin echo (TSE) with fatsat. Assessment: Two readers independently drew a region of interest on ADC maps on the whole tumor (WTu), and on its darkest part (DpTu). Minimum, mean, and maximum ADC values of both WTu and DpTu were compared for receptor status, proliferation rate, and molecular subtypes. Statistical Tests: Wilcoxon rank sum, Mann–Whitney U-tests for associations between radiologic features and histopathology; histogram and q-q plots, Shapiro–Wilk's test to assess normality, concordance correlation coefficient for precision and accuracy; receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Results: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status had significantly different ADC values for both readers. Maximum WTu (P = 0.0004 and 0.0005) and mean WTu (P = 0.0101 and 0.0136) were significantly lower for ER-positive tumors, while PR-positive tumors had significantly lower maximum WTu values (P = 0.0089 and 0.0047).

To date, there have been few inconsistent descriptions of PROs in low-income and middle-income Asian countries. Using a standard questionnaire developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM), we compared the perceived importance of PROs between patients in Malaysia and those in HICs and between clusters of Malaysian women. Methods: Breast cancer patients were recruited from three Malaysian hospitals between June and November 2017. We compared the proportion of patients who rated PROs as very important (scored 7-9 on a 9-point Likert scale) between Malaysian patients and data collected from patients in HICs via the ICHOM questionnaire development process, using logistic regression. A two-step cluster analysis explored differences in PROs among Malaysian patients. Results: The most important PROs for both cohorts were survival, overall well-being, and physical functioning.

However, no study has explored the prognostic value of the combined use of CTC and ccfDNA. We aimed to investigate individual and joint effects of CTC and ccfDNA on clinical outcomes of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. Methods: We collected 227 blood samples from 117 MBC patients. CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch System. ccfDNAs were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Qubit fluorometer. The individual and joint effects of CTC and ccfDNA levels on patient progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Compared to patients with <5 CTCs, patients with ≥5 CTCs had a 2.58-fold increased risk of progression and 3.63-fold increased risk of death. High level of ccfDNA was associated with a 2.05-fold increased risk of progression and 3.56-fold increased risk of death. These associations remained significant after adjusting for other important clinical covariates and CTC/ccfDNA levels. CTC and ccfDNA levels had a joint effect on patient outcomes. Compared to patients with low levels of both CTC and ccfDNA, those with high levels of both markers exhibited a >17-fold increased death risk (P < 0.001). Moreover, longitudinal analysis of 132 samples from 22 patients suggested that the inconsistency between CTC level and outcome in some patients could possibly be explained by ccfDNA level. Conclusions: CTC and total ccfDNA levels were individually and jointly associated with PFS and OS in MBC patients. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85057878734

Our aim was to determine if there were differences in OS of matched breast cancer patients undergoing lumpectomy versus mastectomy in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients with stage I-III breast cancer in the NCDB (2004-2013) was identified. Propensity score matching (PSM), Kaplan-Meier, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine OS by type of surgery. Results: Of 845,136 patients, 464,052 (54.9%) underwent lumpectomy and 381,084 (45.1%) underwent mastectomy. After PSM, the hazard ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI) for OS in all patients comparing lumpectomy with mastectomy was 1.02 (CI, 1.00-1.04; P = .002). In patients with stage I, II, and III, they were HR 1.27 (CI, 1.23-1.36; P < .001), HR 0.98 (CI, 0.95-1.01; P = .21), and HR 0.83 (CI, 0.80-0.86; P < .001), respectively. In subgroup analyses of all patients by estrogen receptor (ER) status, they were HR 1.05 (CI, 1.03-1.07; P < .001) and HR 1.00 (CI, 0.96-1.03; P = .65) in ER+ and ER− patients. Conclusion: In our primary model of all stage I-III matched patients, using the most recent NCDB data and the largest observational sample size to date, the OS after mastectomy was not inferior to lumpectomy. This finding can be reassuring to patients and providers. In subgroup analyses, the association between type of surgery and OS differed by cancer stage and hormone receptor status. In a propensity score–matched investigation of more than 800,000 patients with breast cancer in the National Cancer Database, the effect of surgery type (lumpectomy vs. mastectomy) on overall survival was dependent on cancer stage and hormone receptor status. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062617509

Unacceptable between-laboratory variability has limited its clinical value. The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group investigated whether Ki67 immunohistochemistry can be analytically validated and standardized across laboratories using automated machine-based scoring. Sets of pre-stained core-cut biopsy sections of 30 breast tumors were circulated to 14 laboratories for scanning and automated assessment of the average and maximum percentage of tumor cells positive for Ki67. Seven unique scanners and 10 software platforms were involved in this study. Pre-specified analyses included evaluation of reproducibility between all laboratories (primary) as well as among those using scanners from a single vendor (secondary). The primary reproducibility metric was intraclass correlation coefficient between laboratories, with success considered to be intraclass correlation coefficient >0.80. Intraclass correlation coefficient for automated average scores across 16 operators was 0.83 (95% credible interval: 0.73–0.91) and intraclass correlation coefficient for maximum scores across 10 operators was 0.63 (95% credible interval: 0.44–0.80). For the laboratories using scanners from a single vendor (8 score sets), intraclass correlation coefficient for average automated scores was 0.89 (95% credible interval: 0.81–0.96), which was similar to the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 (95% credible interval: 0.81–0.93) achieved using these same slides in a prior visual-reading reproducibility study. Automated machine assessment of average Ki67 has the potential to achieve between-laboratory reproducibility similar to that for a rigorously standardized pathologist-based visual assessment of Ki67. The observed intraclass correlation coefficient was worse for maximum compared to average scoring methods, suggesting that maximum score methods may be suboptimal for consistent measurement of proliferation. Automated average scoring methods show promise for assessment of Ki67 scoring, but requires further standardization and subsequent clinical validation. © 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","Final",,2-s2.0-85052968575

This study investigates whether non–English-speaking (NES) patients present at a later stage than their English-speaking (ES) counterparts and whether language is associated with mammographic screening. Methods: This study was a retrospective, single-institution cohort analysis of women undergoing breast radiotherapy from 2012 to 2017 (n = 1057). Patients were categorized as ES (n = 904) or NES (n = 153). Ordinal logistic regression analysis identified variables associated with later stage presentation, including language, race/ethnicity, and age. A subcohort analysis investigated the influence of mammographic screening on stage for NES patients. Results: NES patients had greater odds of later stage disease than ES patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence, 1.001-2.150). This association persisted across all races/ethnicities. An additional analysis examined age categories associated with mammographic screening. For women eligible for screening (ie, those 40-50 years old or older than 50 years), there was a significant association between language and stage. NES patients older than 50 years were twice as likely to present at an advanced stage in comparison with ES patients (16.19% vs 8.11%; P =.0082). An additional subset analysis accounted for mammograms. NES patients who did not undergo screening had a higher probability of stage III disease (40.3% of NES patients vs 12.7% of ES patients). There was no difference in stage between NES and ES patients who did undergo screening. Conclusions: Language is independently associated with later stage breast cancer for NES patients, regardless of race/ethnicity. NES patients may have difficulty in accessing the health care system. Future interventions should seek to reduce language barriers for mammographic screening and diagnosis. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061592782

Long-term MBC survival was defined as ≥5 years from date of MBC diagnosis (n = 122), short-term MBC survival as ≤2 years (n = 191). Differences were assessed using t tests, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, χ 2 , and Fisher exact tests. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Long-term survivors were significantly (P &lt;.05) younger, premenopausal, partnered, had estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and HER2-positive disease, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, lower rates of visceral metastases, and higher household income.

Purpose: To assess the effect of determining axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis by breast MRI-derived radiomic signatures, and compare the discriminating abilities of different MR sequences. Study Type: Retrospective. Population: In all, 120 breast cancer patients, 59 with ALN metastasis and 61 without metastasis, all confirmed by pathology. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T scanner with T 1 -weighted imaging, T 2 -weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences. Assessment: Typical morphological and texture features of the segmented tumor were extracted from four sequences, ie, T 1 WI, T 2 WI, DWI, and the second postcontrast phase (CE2) of the dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences. Additional contrast enhancement kinetic features were extracted from all DCE sequences (one pre- and seven postcontrast phases). Linear discriminant analysis classifiers were built and compared when using features from an individual sequence or the combination of the sequences in differentiating the ALN metastasis status. Statistical Tests: Mann–Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed. Results: The accuracy/AUC of the four sequences was 79%/0.87, 77%/0.85, 74%/0.79, and 79%/0.85 for the T 1 WI, CE2, T 2 WI, and DWI, respectively. When CE2 was augmented by adding kinetic features, the model achieved the highest performance (accuracy = 0.86 and AUC = 0.91). When all features from the four sequences and the kinetics were combined, it did not lead to a further increase in the performance (P = 0.48). Data Conclusion: Breast tumor's radiomic signatures from preoperative breast MRI sequences are associated with the ALN metastasis status, where CE2 phase and the contrast enhancement kinetic features lead to the highest classification effect.

We examined racial/ethnic differences in enrollment of women with breast cancer (probands) and their first-degree relatives in the Northern California site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry from 1996 to 2011. Methods: We evaluated participation in several study components, including biospecimen collection, for probands and relatives by race/ethnicity, cancer history, and other factors. Results: Of 4,780 eligible probands, 76% enrolled in the family registry by completing the family history and risk factor questionnaires and 68% also provided a blood or mouthwash sample. Enrollment was highest (81%) for non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and intermediate (73–76%) for Hispanics, African Americans, and all Asian American subgroups, except Filipina women (66%).

Previously reported limitations of the PB algorithm for proton therapy are mainly focused on high-density gradients and small-field dosimetry, the effect of PB algorithms on intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for breast cancer has yet to be illuminated. In this study, we examined 20 patients with breast cancer and systematically investigated the dosimetric impact of MC and PB algorithms on IMPT. Four plans were generated for each patient: (a) a PB plan that optimized and computed the final dose using a PB algorithm; (b) a MC-recomputed plan that recomputed the final dose of the PB plan using a MC algorithm; (c) a MC-renormalized plan that renormalized the MC-recomputed plan to restore the target coverage; and (d) a MC-optimized plan that optimized and computed the final dose using a MC algorithm. The DVH on CTVs and on organ-at-risks (OARs) from each plan were studied. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used for testing the differences between any two types of plans. We found that PB algorithms significantly overestimated the target dose in breast IMPT plans. The median value of the CTV D 99% , D 95% , and D mean dropped by 3.7%, 3.4%, and 2.1%, respectively, of the prescription dose in the MC-recomputed plans compared with the PB plans. The magnitude of the target dose overestimation by the PB algorithm was higher for the breast CTV than for the chest wall CTV. In the MC-renormalized plans, the target dose coverage was comparable with the original PB plans, but renormalization led to a significant increase in target hot spots as well as skin dose. The MC-optimized plans led to sufficient target dose coverage, acceptable target hot spots, and good sparing of skin and other OARs. Utilizing the MC algorithm for both plan optimization and final dose computation in breast IMPT treatment planning is therefore desirable. © 2018 University of Florida.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85057818965

The signature profile of APPs in breast cancer (BC) is poorly understood. Here, we identified serum amyloid A (SAA) for proinflammatory predisposition in BC through the signature profiles of APPs, interleukin (IL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily using publicly available datasets of tumor samples and cell lines. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype highly expressed SAA1/2 compared to HER2, luminal A (LA) and luminal B (LB) subtypes. IL1A, IL1B, IL8/CXCL8, IL32 and IL27RA in IL superfamily and CD70, TNFSF9 and TNFRSF21 in TNF superfamily were highly expressed in TNBC compared to other subtypes. SAA is restrictedly regulated by nuclear factor (NF)-κB and IL-1β, an NF-κB activator highly expressed in TNBC, increased the promoter activity of SAA1 in human TNBC MDA-MB231 cells. Interestingly, two κB-sites contained in SAA1 promoter were involved, and the proximal region (-96/-87) was more critical than the distal site (-288/-279) in regulating IL-1β-induced SAA1. Among the SAA receptors, TLR1 and TLR2 were highly expressed in TNBC. Cu-CPT22, TLR1/2 antagonist, abrogated IL-1β-induced SAA1 promoter activity. In addition, SAA1 induced IL8/ CXCL8 promoter activity, which was partially reduced by Cu-CPT22. Notably, SAA1/2, TLR2 and IL8/CXCL8 were associated with a poor overall survival in mesenchymal-like TNBC.

Studies in vivo and in vitro have confirmed that β-blockers (β-AR antagonists) exert antitumor effects on various tumors. Furthermore, ADRB2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified to alter the expression and conformation of β 2 -AR, which may alter the β-blocker drug response. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of β-blockers on triple-negative breast cancer cells and determine whether ADRB2 SNPs affect the response to β-blocker drugs. Propranolol and ICI 118,551 significantly inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells, arrested cell cycle progression at G 0 /G 1 and S phase and induced cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis indicated that the phosphorylation levels of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and the expression levels of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) were significantly decreased following β-blocker treatment. Four haplotypes, which comprised ADRB2 SNPs rs1042713 and rs1042714, were transfected into 293 cells. After 24 and 48 h of transfection, ADRB2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in mutant groups compared with the wild-type group. The ADRB2 SNPs exerted no effect on cell viability, but did affect the drug response of ICI 118,551. Furthermore, ADRB2 SNPs also affected the regulatory function of ICI 118,551 on the ERK/COX-2 signaling pathway. Collectively, propranolol and ICI 118,551 inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells by downregulating the ERK/COX-2 signaling pathway and inducing apoptosis. The results of the present study indicated that SNPs rs1042713 and rs1042714 of ADRB2 affected the response to ICI 118,551, and the underlying molecular mechanism was elucidated. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Literature on decision making about breast cancer prevention focuses on individual perceptions and attitudes that predict chemoprevention use, rather than the process by which women decide whether to take risk-reducing medications. This secondary analysis aimed to understand how women’s perceptions of breast cancer risk and locus of control influence their decision making. Methods. Women were accrued as part of the NRG Oncology/National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Decision-Making Project 1, a study aimed at understanding contributors to chemoprevention uptake. Thirty women participated in qualitative in-depth interviews after being counseled about chemoprevention. Deductive codes grouped women based on dimensions of risk perception and locus of control. We used a constant comparative method to make connections among inductive themes focused on decision making, deductive codes for perceived risk and perceived locus of control, and the influence of explanatory models within and across participants. Results. Participants were predominantly non-Hispanic white (63%), with an average age of 50.9 years. Decision making varied across groups: the high-perceived risk/high-perceived control group used “social evidence” to model the behaviors of others. High-perceived risk/low-perceived control women made decisions based on beliefs about treatment, rooted in the experiences of social contacts. The low-perceived risk/low-perceived control group interpreted signs of risk as part of the normal continuum of bodily changes in comparison to others. Low-perceived risk/high-perceived control women focused on maintaining a current healthy trajectory. Conclusion. “Social evidence” plays an important role in the decision-making process that is distinct from emotional aspects. Attending to patients’ perceptions of risk and control in conjunction with social context is key to caring for patients at high risk in a way that is evidence based and sensitive to patient preferences. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062342806

A 21-gene assay allows clinicians to predict who will not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and avoid systemic toxicities. Physicians are using the recurrence score to guide chemotherapy selection, despite the lack of evidence. In this study we examined factors associated with prescribing patterns for an anthracycline-based chemotherapy in hormone receptor-positive stage I to III breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study using the Michigan Breast Oncology Quality Initiative data set (February 1, 2006 to December 31, 2015). Women with histologically confirmed stage I to III invasive breast cancer with estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor-positive, HER2/neu-negative receptor status were included. We used χ 2 analysis to determine associations of these characteristics with the 21-gene assay score and anthracycline use. Results: A total of 17,788 patients were evaluated. Most tumors were stage I (60%). Most procedures were lumpectomy with radiation (66%). Anthracyclines were used more often in stage III patients (69%), younger patients (40% for patients younger than 65 years), and those with higher 21-gene recurrence scores. Patients with low recurrence scores were more likely to receive anthracyclines if lymph node-positive (10%) than if lymph node-negative (1%; P &lt;.001). Patients with high recurrence scores and lymph node-positive status were just as likely to receive an anthracycline-based as a nonanthracycline-based regimen (47.5% vs. 49.2%; P =.89).

However, the association of patient race or ethnicity with subtypes of TNBC and clinical outcome has not been addressed. Using nCounter Gene Expression Codesets, we classified TNBCs into subtypes: basal-like immune-activated (BLIA), basal-like immunosuppressed (BLIS), luminal androgen receptor (LAR), and mesenchymal (MES) in 48 Hispanic, 12 African-American, 21 Asian, and 34 White patients. Mean age at diagnosis was significantly associated with subtype, with the youngest mean age (50 years) in MES and the oldest mean age (64 years) in LAR (p < 0.0005). Subtype was significantly associated with tumor grade (p = 0.0012) and positive lymph nodes (p = 0.021), with a marginally significant association of tumor stage (p = 0.076). In multivariate Cox-proportional hazards modeling, BLIS was associated with worst survival and LAR with best survival. Hispanics had a significantly higher proportion of BLIS (53%, p = 0.03), whereas Asians had a lower proportion of BLIS (19%, p = 0.05) and a higher proportion of LAR (38%, p = 0.06) compared to the average proportion across all groups. These differences in proportions of subtype across racial and ethnic groups may explain differences in their outcomes. Determining subtypes of TNBC facilitates understanding of the heterogeneity of the TNBCs and provides a foundation for developing subtype-specific therapies and better predictors of TNBC prognosis for all races and ethnicities. © 2019 Impact Journals LLC.

Using the Prospective Family Study Cohort, we used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of BBD with BC risk. We also examined whether the association with BBD differed by underlying familial risk profile (FRP), calculated using absolute risk estimates from the Breast Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) model. During 176,756 person-years of follow-up (median: 10.9 years, maximum: 23.7) of 17,154 women unaffected with BC at baseline, we observed 968 incident cases of BC. A total of 4,704 (27%) women reported a history of BBD diagnosis at baseline. A history of BBD was associated with a greater risk of BC: HR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.14–1.50), and did not differ by underlying FRP, with HRs of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.11–1.65), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.00–1.60), and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.01–1.93), for categories of full-lifetime BOADICEA score &lt;20%, 20 to &lt;35%, ≥35%, respectively.

TNBC has higher recurrence, metastasis, and mortality rates than other subtypes of breast cancer. Mounting data suggest that the MAPK (also known as RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) pathway is an important therapeutic target in TNBC. Methods: To evaluate anti-tumor and anti-metastasis efficacy of E6201, we used cell proliferation assay, soft agar assay, cell cycle assay, Annexin V staining assay, immunoblotting analysis, immunohistochemistry, migration assay, invasion assay, mammary fat pad xenograft, and experimental and spontaneous metastasis xenograft models. We also evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of E6201 plus CDK4/6 inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor, or ATR inhibitor. Results: E6201 inhibited TNBC cell colony formation, migration, and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. E6201 induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. E6201 inhibited TNBC xenograft growth and inhibited TNBC lung metastasis and improved mouse survival in experimental metastasis and spontaneous metastasis assays. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that E6201 decreased the metastatic burden in the lung and decreased phosphorylated ERK expression in a dose-dependent manner. Combination of E6201 with CDK4/6 inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor enhanced E6201’s in vitro anti-tumor efficacy. Conclusion: These results indicate that E6201 exhibits anti-tumor efficacy against TNBC in vitro and anti-metastasis efficacy against TNBC in vivo.

Among the most serious of these toxicities is haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threatening disorder of unbridled immune activation that results in injury to multiple organ systems. Objective Description of a case of pembrolizumab-associated HLH in a patient with a proposed underlying genetic risk factor for its occurrence. Methods and results We describe a patient with aggressive metastatic breast cancer who developed HLH while undergoing experimental treatment with pembrolizumab, resulting in critical illness and multiorgan system failure. Pembrolizumab discontinuation and high-dose corticosteroids were effective in managing HLH. Subsequent next-generation sequencing of 15 genes associated with HLH revealed a germline polymorphism in perforin-1 (PRF1), PRFA91V, that may have predisposed the patient to develop HLH. The patient has had no evidence of malignancy for 2 years following recovery despite receiving no further cancer-directed treatment. Conclusions HLH is a rare but serious complication of immune checkpoint blockade. Patients with underlying hypomorphic alleles in PRF1 may be predisposed to develop this toxicity. Further studies are necessary to confirm a possible link between perforin gene mutations and immune checkpoint blockade-associated HLH. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054555617

However, how to accurately detect residual tumors is still a challenge. In this work, we tried to use multiphoton imaging to look for residual breast tumors after preoperative therapy. Imaging results demonstrate that multiphoton microscopy can identify remaining tumor tissues and can even detect rarely residual tumor cells, which would be helpful for surgeons to accurately assess the surgical margin in real time to confirm negative margins during operation. We also performed a quantification analysis of the nuclear area of tumor cells before and after treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The measurement data show that the tumor cell nuclei after chemotherapy are significantly larger than those without treatment, and there is a statistically significant difference in the nuclear areas between the pre-treatment and post-treatment mammary carcinoma. Our pilot study indicates the potential utility of multiphoton imaging for detecting residual breast carcinoma tissues in fresh, ex vivo specimens without the use of exogenous contrast agents.

METHODS: Sister Study participants (n = 50,884), breast cancer-free women who had a sister with breast cancer were recruited, from 2003 to 2009. The 2005 Environmental Protection Agency National Air Toxic Assessment's census-tract estimates of metal concentrations in air (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium) were matched to participants' enrollment residence. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between quintiles of individual metals and breast cancer incidence and weighted quantile sum regression to model the association between the metal mixture and breast cancer. RESULTS: A total of 2,587 breast cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up (mean = 7.4 years). In individual chemical analyses comparing the highest to lowest quintiles, postmenopausal breast cancer risk was elevated for mercury (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1, 1.5), cadmium (HR = 1.1, 95% CI, 0.96, 1.3), and lead (HR = 1.1, 95% CI, 0.98, 1.3). The weighted quantile sum index was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1, 95% CI, 1.0, 1.1). Consistent with the individual chemical analysis, the most highly weighted chemicals for predicting postmenopausal breast cancer risk were lead, cadmium, and mercury.

This study was designed to determine whether breast cancer cells with stemlike properties are present in residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and whether they exhibit oncogenic mutations. The presence of breast cancer cells with stemlike properties with specific mutations may help explain the poor prognosis associated with residual disease. Methods: A total of 68 breast cancer specimens were collected at the time of mastectomy or lumpectomy. A total of 44 were chemotherapy naïve and 24 were collected as residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor cells were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, with breast cancer cells with stemlike properties specifically identified using breast stem cell associated antibodies. Whole tumor specimens and fluorescence-activated cell sorting breast cancer cells with stemlike properties were analyzed for genetic mutations, including PIK3CA. Results: Breast cancer cells with stemlike properties, demonstrating EpCAM-positive, CD44-positive, CD49f ± , CD24 ± expression were present in chemotherapy-naïve tumors and residual disease. In both chemotherapy-naïve and residual disease specimens the highest frequency of PIK3CA mutations were detected in CD49f-CD24+ BCSCs (39% and 33%, respectively). PIK3CA mutations were detected in all stages of breast cancer (35%), in both chemotherapy naïve (39%) and residual disease (29%) and in both estrogen receptor positive (41%) and negative tumors (14%) (P = ns). Various PIK3CA mutations were identified in chemotherapy-naïve specimens versus residual disease specimens in both patient-paired and unpaired breast cancers. Conclusion: Breast cancer cells with stemlike properties with mutations in PIK3CA were present in chemotherapy-naïve breast cancers and residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These results demonstrate that neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not completely eradicate PIK3CA-defective breast cancer cells with stemlike properties.

Our objective was to determine the impact of PIM on outcomes in patients with breast and colorectal cancers receiving chemotherapy. Methods: We used data from the SEER-Medicare database, including patients >/= 66 years old with a diagnosis of Stage II/III breast and colorectal cancer made between 7/1/2007–12/31/2009. We used modified STOPP criteria to define baseline PIM as a dichotomous variable in the 4 months prior to diagnosis. STOPP criteria was used based on its performance as a robust measure of PIM. Outcomes measures included ER visits, hospitalizations, and death within 3 months from the last chemotherapy, and a composite of the three. We used Chi-square or Fisher's exact test to determine associations of PIM with covariates and outcomes, and Cox proportional hazards (PH) model for the time-to-event analysis. Results: Final analysis included 1,595 patients with breast cancer and 1,528 patients with colorectal cancer. Frequency of baseline PIM by STOPP was 31.5% in the breast and 30.9% in the colorectal cohort. In the breast cohort, associations with the composite outcome in the Cox PH model included disease stage, comorbidity, medication number and baseline ER visits/hospitalization. Age, gender, race, comorbidity and baseline ER visits/hospitalization were associated in the colorectal cohort. PIM was not associated with outcomes in either cohort, aside from hospitalization in the breast. Conclusions: We found no consistent association between pre-chemotherapy PIM defined by STOPP and outcomes. © 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061671760

Less is known about how family history of breast cancer affects the association and whether it varies by menopausal status. Methods: The Sister Study is a cohort of 50,884 women who had a sister with breast cancer but no prior breast cancer themselves at enrollment. Women reported all recreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past 12 months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered in association with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history, examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporating characteristics of the family structure. Results: During follow-up (average 8.4 years), 3,023 cases were diagnosed. Higher hours/week (HR≥7vs&lt;1 = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.90) and MET-hours/week (HRquartile4vs1 = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67–0.85) of physical activity were associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk.

The cardiac safety of continuing trastuzumab in patients with asymptomatic LVEF decline is unknown. We report the cardiac outcomes of patients treated with trastuzumab after a significant asymptomatic LVEF decline. Methods: Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and asymptomatic LVEF decline to < 50% during trastuzumab were identified from an institutional echocardiogram database. Patients who received trastuzumab with a LVEF < 50% were classified as the continued group, whereas patients who had trastuzumab held until LVEF improved to ≥ 50% or who had trastuzumab permanently discontinued were classified as the interrupted group. Cardiac events were defined as HF (New York Heart Association class III–IV) or cardiovascular death. Results: Sixty patients were included; the median age was 54 years. In 23 patients who continued trastuzumab, 14 (61%) tolerated trastuzumab without a cardiac event, 6 (26%) developed worsening LVEF (range 25–42%) leading to trastuzumab discontinuation, and three (13%) developed a cardiac event (1 HF, 2 possible/probable cardiovascular deaths). In 37 patients with interrupted trastuzumab, 15 (41%) were re-challenged with trastuzumab after LVEF improved to > 50%, 21 (57%) were not re-challenged, and one (3%) developed HF. More patients in the continued trastuzumab group had metastatic disease (39% vs. 5%, p = 0.002). The final LVEF after median follow-up of 633 days was similar between patients with trastuzumab continuation versus interruption (54% vs. 56%, p = 0.29). Conclusion: Continuation of trastuzumab after an asymptomatic LVEF decline to < 50% in patients who are expected to benefit from additional anti-HER2 therapy is a promising approach that warrants further investigation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061176491

A breast cancer diagnosis in this young patient population can be uniquely complex to navigate when considering the potential impact of fertility loss associated with specific gonadotoxic therapies. Another unique challenge for young breast cancer patients is pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC), which occurs in approximately 1 of every 3000 pregnancies. Pregnancy adds a layer of complexity to breast cancer treatment planning as many therapies can affect the developing fetus. These two clinical challenges require nuanced multidisciplinary approaches to facilitate optimal treatment outcomes. We sought to review and summarize the management strategy options for both fertility preservation and PABC. Methods: A guideline and literature review was performed for fertility preservation, young patients with breast cancer, and pregnancy-associated breast cancer. Results: Fertility preservation options, both established and experimental, are detailed. Suggested clinical practice guidelines for PABC are also presented, which delineate breast cancer treatment recommendations based on pregnancy trimester. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary approach to patient care, including oncologists and early referral to reproductive specialists, can provide young breast cancer patients with options for fertility preservation. Under the guidance of a multidisciplinary treatment team, PABC can also be diagnosed and treated to permit the best possible outcomes for the mother and the developing fetus. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85060761135

Although UED has been linked to quality of life (QoL), the role of UED as mediator between contemporary treatment practices and QoL has not been quantified. This investigation describes UED in a contemporary sample of breast cancer patients and examines its relationship with personal and treatment factors and QoL. Methods: Eight hundred and thirty-three women diagnosed at eight medical institutions during 2013–2014 with microscopically confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive stage I–III breast cancer were surveyed an average of 22 months after diagnosis. UED was measured with a modified QuickDASH and QoL with the FACT-B. The questionnaire also collected treatments, sociodemographic information, comorbidity, body mass index, and a 3-item health literacy screener. Results: Women who received post-mastectomy radiation and chemotherapy experienced significantly worse UED and QoL. Women who had lower income, lower health literacy and prior diabetes, arthritis or shoulder diagnoses had worse UED. Patients with worse UED reported significantly worse QoL. Income and health literacy were independently associated with QoL after adjustment for UED but treatment and prior conditions were not, indicating mediation by UED. UED mediated 52–79% of the effect of mastectomy-based treatments on QoL as compared with unilateral mastectomy without radiation. UED and QoL did not differ by type of axillary surgery or post-mastectomy reconstruction. Conclusions: A large portion of treatment effect on QoL is mediated by UED.

This study examined breast cancer risk among Asian American women by nativity and percentage of life lived in the United States, accounting for established breast cancer risk factors. Methods We analyzed a breast cancer case-control data set of Asian American women living in the San Francisco Bay Area; this data set included 132 cases of women with breast cancer selected from a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and 438 Asian American women without diagnosed breast cancer matched to cases by age and country of origin. We used logistic regression to compare 3 Asian American groups: US-born, immigrants who lived 50% or more of their life in the United States, and immigrants who lived less than 50% of their life in the United States. Results In the minimally adjusted and fully adjusted models, both groups of immigrant Asian American women had higher risk of breast cancer than US-born Asian American women. In the fully adjusted model, compared with US-born Asian American women, immigrant Asian American women who lived more than 50% of their life in United States were on average 3 times as likely (odds ratio = 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-5.75) and immigrants who lived less than 50% of their life in United States were on average 2.46 times as likely (odds ratio = 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.99) to have breast cancer.

Palbociclib, is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, and when patients are treated in combination with fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor antagonist, they have improved progression-free survival. The mechanisms for this survival advantage are not known. Therefore, we analyzed metabolic and transcriptomic changes in MCF-7 cells following single and combination chemotherapy to determine whether selective metabolic pathways are targeted during these different modes of treatment. Individually, the drugs caused metabolic disruption to the same metabolic pathways, however fulvestrant additionally attenuated the pentose phosphate pathway and the production of important coenzymes. A comprehensive effect was observed when the drugs were applied together, confirming the combinatory therapy’s synergism in the cell model.

Little is known regarding how these choices contribute to decisional regret, which is a negative emotion reflecting the idea that another surgery or radiation decision might have been preferable. We sought to characterize the burden of and examine potential risk factors for local therapy decisional regret among a population-based cohort of older breast cancer survivors. Methods and Materials: National Medicare claims for age ≥67 female breast cancer incident in 2009 identified patients treated with lumpectomy plus whole-breast irradiation, brachytherapy, or endocrine therapy or mastectomy with or without radiation. We sampled 330 patients per treatment group (N = 1650), of whom 1253 agreed to receive a paper survey including the Decisional Regret Scale and EQ-5D-3L Health-Utility Scale. Local therapy regret was defined as neutral or worse response to questions regarding surgery- or radiation-related decisional regret. Local therapy regret risk factors were evaluated using a multivariable generalized linear model. Association of local therapy regret with health utility was modeled using multivariable linear regression. Results: The response rate was 30.2% (n = 498 of 1650); 421 surveys were included in this analysis. Median diagnosis age was 72 years, and surveys were completed 6 years after diagnosis. Overall, 23.8% of respondents (n = 100) reported experiencing local therapy decisional regret. Type of local therapy was not associated with local therapy regret. Predictors of increased regret included black race (risk ratio [RR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-3.29), high school education or less (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.27-2.75), and axillary nodal dissection (RR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.33-3.41). Local therapy regret was not associated with health utility (P =.37). Conclusions: Local therapy regret afflicts nearly one quarter of our cohort of older breast cancer survivors, and it is associated with black race, less education, and more extensive nodal dissection, but not breast surgery. Regret is distinct from health utility, suggesting that it is a unique psychosocial construct that merits further study and mitigation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062241050

We isolated exosomes from serum of breast cancer patients and healthy donors, then we characterized them according to their shape, size, and exosome markers by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blot and determined the exosome concentration in all samples by NTA. Later, exosomal small RNA extraction was done to determine the expression levels of miR-145, miR-155, and miR-382 by qRT-PCR. We observed a round shape of exosomes with a mean size of 119.84 nm in breast cancer patients and 115.4 nm in healthy donors.

We performed a study to project the potential cost-effectiveness of THP vs. TH. Study Design: Trial-based cost-utility modeling analysis. Methods: We performed an economic evaluation from a payer perspective using a Markov model with six health states: invasive disease-free survival, non-metastatic recurrence, remission, first-line metastatic, subsequent line metastatic, and death. We parameterized the model using data from both arms in APHINITY extrapolated to a patient's lifetime horizon. Estimates of health state utilities were based on EQ-5D trial data and the literature, and costs were estimated from government sources and the published literature. The primary outcomes of the model were life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty was addressed via univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: For the intention-to-treat population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.50 LYs and 0.45 QALYs) and increased costs (by $74 420) for ICERs of $147 774/LY gained and $167 185/QALY gained for PHT vs. HT patients. In the node-positive patient population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.86 LYs and 0.76 QALYs) and increased costs (by $66 647) for ICERs of $77 684/LY gained and $87 929/QALY gained. For the hormone-receptor-negative patient population, the model projected health gains, increased costs, and ICERs of $147 022/LY gained and $166 518/QALY gained.

Methodology: We assessed levels of PBP and psychological factors in breast cancer survivors (Survivor Group: n = 417; Stages I-IIIA; White = 88.7%; Age M = 59.4 years) at their first surveillance mammogram post-surgery (6–15 months). A comparison group of women without histories of breast surgery or cancer (Non-cancer Group: n = 587; White = 78.7%; Age M = 57.4 years) was similarly assessed at the time of a routine screening mammogram. All women completed measures of breast pain, pain catastrophizing, perceived breast cancer risk, and worry that breast pain indicates cancer, as well as measures of emotional distress (symptoms of anxiety, symptoms of depression, and mammography-specific distress). Analyses included race, age, BMI, education, and menopausal status as covariates, with significance set at 0.05. Results: As expected, PBP prevalence was significantly higher in the Survivor Group than in the Non-cancer Group (50.6% vs. 17.5%). PBP+ survivors also had significantly higher levels of emotional distress, pain catastrophizing, mammography-specific distress, and worry that breast pain indicates cancer, compared to PBP− survivors. Structural equation modeling results were significant for all hypothesized mediational pathways. Interestingly, comparisons of PBP+ to PBP− women in the Non-cancer Group showed similar results. Conclusion: These findings suggest the importance of (a) pain catastrophizing, (b) perceived breast cancer risk and, (c) worry that breast pain may indicate cancer, as potential targets for interventions aimed at reducing the negative psychological impact of PBP in post-surgery breast cancer survivors, as well as in unaffected women with PBP due to unknown reasons. © 2019, © 2019 Acta Oncologica Foundation.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061509034

Individuals with lymphedema may experience chronic and progressive swelling, recurrent skin infections, and decreased self-image and quality of life. For many years, it was considered best practice for this population to avoid exercise; however, in recent years, research has begun to challenge this belief. This systematic review and meta-analyses examined the recent literature on the effects of exercise for patients with, or at risk for, BCRL to inform best practice. Methods ?A total of 807 articles were retrieved from CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Medline, and PubMed. Results were systematically filtered to 26 articles through inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool for quantitative studies. Data were pooled from studies containing relative and absolute volume measurements of limb volume, as well as upper extremity function measured by the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire; meta-analyses were conducted using SAS software. Results ?The literature was reviewed and statistically analyzed. Results have indicated aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, stretching, yoga, qigong, and pilates can be safe and effective in the management of symptoms for those with, or at risk for, BCRL. Conclusion ?Several forms of exercise appear to be safe interventions for clinicians to use when treating this population and offer benefits such as improved quality of life, strength, body mass index, and mental health and decreased pain and lymphatic swelling. Additional research should be conducted to further examine the efficacy and safety of nontraditional forms of exercise in the treatment of BCRL. © 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059493989

Methods: This study is a prospective cohort study which draws from a larger original study which examined the utility of FLT-PET imaging across multiple cancers. Our cohort consisted of patients who had biopsy-confirmed breast cancer amenable to surgical resection. These patients underwent serial FLT-PET scans: the first scan prior to starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and a second scan shortly after starting NAC. SUV mean was derived using an isocontour ROI drawn approximately half way between the SUV max and background on three planes for each scan. The change in mean standardized uptake value (SUV mean ) for the primary tumor between these two scans was then calculated, and patients were stratified into “responder” and “non-responder” groups based on a cut-off of 20% arithmetic decrease in SUV mean between the two scans. The rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) on subsequent surgical excision, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were then compared between the two groups to assess for significant difference between responders and non-responders. Results: 16 patients (n = 16) met criteria for inclusion and successfully underwent FLT-PET scans in the prescribed sequence of events. Seven of these patients had a decrease of 20% or larger between the two serial PET scans, making them “responders”. The remaining nine patients were “non-responders” to NAC based on PET imaging. Between responders and non-responders, there was no significant difference in median PFS (7.9 years versus 3.7 years; p = 0.425) and median OS (7.5 years versus 5.0 years; p = 0.944). In the 14 patients who underwent surgical resection (n = 14), there was no significant difference in the rate of achieving pCR (33% vs. 14%; p = 0.5846) between responders and non-responders. Conclusion: Further study of a larger sample size is needed to examine the potential role for FLT-PET in predicting response to neoadjuvant treatment, particularly in correlating with long-term overall and progression-free survival. Our study is limited by small sample size, but does suggest that FLT-PET has a role in the long-term prognosis of breast cancer treated with NAC and surgical resection which is worthy of further study. © 2019, The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062601776

We aimed to identify distinct lifestyle patterns based on five behavior/dietary exposures among a population-based sample of women diagnosed with breast cancer and to examine their association with subsequent survival. METHODS: In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Phases I/II, we interviewed 1,808 women 20-74 years of age following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. We determined vital status using the National Death Index (717 deaths, 427 from breast cancer; median follow-up 13.56 years). We assessed lifestyle patterns using a latent class analysis based on five behavioral and dietary exposures: current versus never/former smokers; low versus high vegetable and fruit intake; high and low/moderate, versus no alcohol consumption; and no and low/moderate, versus high regular physical activity. We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality, and cause-specific and subdistribution HRs for breast cancer-specific mortality within 5 years and 13 years postdiagnosis conditional on 5-year survival. RESULTS: We identified three distinct lifestyle patterns: healthy behavior and diet (n = 916); healthy behavior and unhealthy diet (n = 624); and unhealthy behavior and diet (n = 268). The unhealthy (vs. healthy) behavior and diet pattern was associated with a 13-year conditional all-cause mortality HR of 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1, 1.9) and with 13-year conditional breast cancer-specific and subdistribution HRs of 1.2 (95% CI = 0.79, 1.9) and 1.2 (95% CI = 0.77, 1.8), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and dietary patterns can be used to identify lifestyle patterns that influence survival patterns following breast cancer diagnosis.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057552675

Methods: Trends in utilization of HF-WBI in women diagnosed with T1-2N0 TNBC in the NCDB between 2008 and 2013 were analyzed. Case-matched luminal A women were used for comparison. Variables included age, race, year of diagnosis, insurance status, income quartile, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and institution (academic vs. community). Chi square, logistic regression, and multivariate analysis was performed. Results: Utilization of HF-WBI among the 53,269 TNBC women identified steadily increased from 4.7% in 2008 to 14.0% in 2013 for women with TNBC compared to luminal A cancer whose utilization increased from 7.3 to 23.3% over the same time frame (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, HF-WBI was associated with increasing age (p < 0.001), Medicare insurance (p < 0.001), race (p = 0.041), diagnosis after 2011 (p < 0.001), higher income quartile (p < 0.001), and treatment at academic institutions (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, age (p < 0.001, OR 1.038 per year), income quartile (p = 0.002, OR 1.061 per increase in quartile), treatment at an academic institution (p < 0.001, OR 1.78) significantly increased use of HF-WBI. Conclusions: Treatment at an academic center and year of diagnosis were most correlated with increased HF-WBI in T1-2N0 TNBC women in the NCDB from 2008 to 2013, followed by increasing age and income.

Residual connections were used in the earlier layers to allow stabilization of gradients during backpropagation. Inception style layers were utilized deeper in the network to allow learned segregation of more complex feature mappings. Extensive regularization was utilized including dropout, L2, feature map dropout, and transition layers. The class imbalance was addressed by doubling the input of underrepresented classes and utilizing a class sensitive cost function. Parameters were tuned based on a 20% validation group. A class balanced holdout set of 40 patients was utilized as the testing set. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU.

We hypothesized that targeting these critical pathways would prolong progression-free survival with first-line therapy for metastatic TNBC. Patients and Methods: We conducted a phase II trial of nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab, followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib, for patients with metastatic TNBC. During induction, the patients received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8, and 15) and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (days 1 and 15) every 28 days for 6 cycles. Patients free of progression at 24 weeks received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks and oral erlotinib 150 mg/d until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were best overall response, overall survival (OS), and adverse events. We explored the measurement of circulating tumor cells as a prognostic marker. Results: A total of 55 evaluable patients were enrolled. The median PFS and OS for the cohort was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval, 7.2-11.1) and 18.1 months (95% confidence interval, 15.6-21.7), respectively. Of the 53 patients with measurable disease, 39 (74%) had experienced a partial response and 10 (19%) had stable disease using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. The most common toxicities were uncomplicated neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy. Decreased circulating tumor cells from baseline to the first assessment correlated with longer PFS and OS. Conclusion: Nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab, followed by maintenance targeted therapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib, resulted in PFS similar to that of other trials.

In prior experiments, turmeric-derived curcumin inhibited in vivo BMET progression and in vitro TGFβ/Smad-signaling in a TGFβ-stimulated PTHrP-dependent human xenograft BCa BMET model (MDA-SA cells). However, it is unclear whether curcumin or curcumin-glucuronide mediates in vivo protection since curcumin-glucuronide is the primary circulating metabolite in rodents and in humans. Thus, effects of curcumin vs. curcumin-glucuronide on Smad-dependent TGFβ signaling were compared in a series of BCa cell lines forming TGFβ-dependent BMET in murine models, and tissue-specific metabolism of curcumin in mice was examined by LC–MS. While curcumin inhibited TGFβ-receptor-mediated Smad2/3 phosphorylation in all BCa cells studied (human MDA-SA, MDA-1833, MDA-2287 and murine 4T1 cells), curcumin-glucuronide did not. Similarly, curcumin, but not curcumin-glucuronide, blocked TGFβ-stimulated secretion of PTHrP from MDA-SA and 4T1 cells. Because the predominant serum metabolite, curcumin-glucuronide, lacked bioactivity, we examined tissue-specific metabolism of curcumin in mice. Compared to serum and other organs, free curcumin (both absolute and percentage of total) was significantly increased in bone, which was also a rich source of enzymatic deglucuronidation activity. Thus, curcumin, and not curcumin-glucuronide, appears to inhibit bone-tropic BCa cell TGFβ-signaling and to undergo site-specific activation (deconjugation) within the bone microenvironment. These findings suggest that circulating curcumin-glucuronide may act as a prodrug that preferentially targets bone, a process that may contribute to the bone-protective effects of curcumin and other highly glucuronidated dietary polyphenols. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055633393

ORI indices (such as NADH, FAD, and their ratio) have been under investigation as potential progression/prognosis biomarkers for cancer. Higher FAD redox ratio (i.e., FAD/(FAD + NADH)) has been associated with higher invasive/metastatic potential in tumor xenografts and cultured cells. This study is to examine whether ORI indices can respond to the modulation of oncogene DEK activities that change cancer cell invasive/metastatic potential. Procedures: Using lentiviral shRNA, DEK gene expression was efficiently knocked down in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (DEKsh). These DEKsh cells, along with scrambled shRNA-transduced control cells (NTsh), were imaged with a fluorescence microscope. In vitro invasive potential of the DEKsh cells and NTsh cells was also measured in parallel using the transwell assay. Results: FAD and FAD redox ratios in polyclonal cells with DEKsh were significantly lower than that in NTsh control cells.

Using data from postmenopausal women, a population highly susceptible to obesity, IR, and increased risk of breast cancer, we implemented a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two steps: (1) GWAS meta-analysis of gene–environmental (i.e., behavioral) interaction (G*E) for IR phenotypes (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and homeostatic model assessment–insulin resistance) and (2) after the G*E GWASmeta-analysis, the identified SNPs were tested for their associations with breast cancer risk in overall or subgroup population, where the SNPs were identified at genome-wide significance. We found 58 loci (55 novel SNPs; 5 index SNPs and 6 SNPs, independent of each other) that are associated with IR phenotypes in women overall or women stratified by obesity, physical activity, and high-fat diet; among those 58 loci, 29 (26 new loci; 2 index SNPs and 2 SNPs, independently) were associated with postmenopausal breast cancer. Our study suggests that a number of newly identified SNPs may have their effects on glucose intolerance by interplaying with obesity and other lifestyle factors, and a substantial proportion of these SNPs' susceptibility can also interact with the lifestyle factors to ultimately influence breast cancer risk. These findings may contribute to improved prediction accuracy for cancer and suggest potential intervention strategies for those women carrying genetic risk that will reduce their breast cancer risk. ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059798777

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 1,000 consecutive patients with second opinion radiology interpretations performed by subspecialty-trained breast radiologists at a dedicated cancer center July 1 through December 31, 2016. Of these, 205 included review of outside breast MRI. Outside imaging reports were compared with second opinion reports to categorize breast MRI review discrepancies. These included relevant BI-RADS category changes or identification of additional extent of disease >4 cm. The discrepancy frequency, relevant alterations in patient management, and incremental cancer detection were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test. Results: Discrepant second opinion breast MRI review was seen in 36 of 205 patients (18%). Additional cancer was detected through image-guided biopsy in 3 of these 36 patients and through excision in 2 (5 of 205, 2%). Additionally, five biopsies yielded high-risk pathologic results without upstage on excision. Findings suspicious for additional extent of disease >4 cm were noted in five patients (2%) treated with mastectomies. Finally, five patients had BI-RADS category downgrades. Ultimately, completion of second opinion MRI review recommendations resulted in altered management in 10% of patients (20 of 205). The absence of prior imaging studies for comparison was associated with increased discrepancy frequency (P =.005). Conclusion: Second opinion breast MRI review by subspecialized breast imaging radiologists increases cancer detection and results in clinically relevant changes in patient management. © 2019 American College of Radiology","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062183846

Disease progression and associated costs may affect these models, particularly if such programs do not account for disease severity and progression risk across patient populations. This study estimated the incremental cost of disease progression in patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (mBC), colorectal cancer (mCRC) and lung cancer (mLC) and compared costs among patients with and without progression. Methods: This was a retrospective study using U.S. administrative claims data from commercial and Medicare Advantage health care enrollees with evidence of mBC, mCRC, and mLC and systemic antineoplastic agent use from July 1, 2006, to August 31, 2014. Outcome measures included disease progression, 12-month health care costs, and 3-year cumulative predictive health care costs. Results: Of 5,709 patients with mBC, 3,707 patients with mCRC, and 5,201 patients with mLC, 56.8% of patients with mBC, 58.1% of those with mCRC, and 80.3% of those with mLC patients had evidence of disease progression over 12 months. Among patients with mBC and mCRC, adjusted and unadjusted health care costs were significantly higher among progressors versus nonprogressors. Per-patient-per-month costs, which accounted for variable follow-up time, were almost twice as high among progressors versus nonprogressors in patients with mBC, mCRC, and mLC. In each of the three cancer types, delays in progression were associated with lower health care costs. Conclusion: Progression of mLC, mBC, and mCRC was associated with higher health care costs over a 12-month period. Delayed cancer progression was associated with substantial cost reductions in patients with each of the three cancer types. Implications for Practice: Data on the rates and incremental health care costs of disease progression in patients with solid tumor cancers are lacking. This study estimated the incremental costs of disease progression in patients diagnosed with lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer and compared health care costs in patients with and without evidence of disease progression in a real-world population. The data obtained in our study quantify the economic value of delaying or preventing disease progression and may inform payers and physician groups about value-based payment programs. © AlphaMed Press 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061970658

The Knowledge Summaries for Comprehensive Breast Cancer Control (KSBCs) are a series of evidence-based publications intended to support cancer control planning at various resource levels. The goals of this evaluation research study were to learn about the extent to which the KSBCs could be useful to policymakers, health care providers, and breast cancer advocates in Kenya, and whether introducing the KSBCs led to their uptake, and if so, how they were used. METHODS: This study used one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and self-administered online surveys. Policymakers were recruited from the Ministry of Health. Providers were recruited from four hospitals in two cities, Nairobi and Eldoret, and one rural municipality, Kijabe. Advocates were recruited from cancer advocacy organizations. RESULTS: Twenty individuals participated in the research. They found the KSBCs to be educational reference tools that create a shared planning-related knowledge base among diverse stakeholders. The KSBCs were seen to be applicable to a variety of contexts and stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This study found that the KSBCs can be useful as both an educational tool and a convening tool for multistakeholder engagement in breast cancer prevention and control in a variety of settings. Additional engagement with users of the KSBCs can provide more knowledge about how the KSBCs are used and how they contribute to building collaborations across stakeholder groups to strengthen breast cancer prevention and control in low-resource settings.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060655200

However, there is no clear evidence whether radiotherapy after BCS improves the survival of elderly women diagnosed with early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) BC. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival benefit associated with radiotherapy plus hormonal therapy vs hormonal therapy alone after BCS for early-stage HR+ BC patients. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results linked with Medicare data, we identified elderly (65 years and older) women diagnosed with early-stage HR+ BC (2006-2011) who received hormonal therapy with or without radiotherapy after BCS. A log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score matching were used to estimate the overall survival (OS) benefit associated with radiotherapy after BCS. RESULTS: Of the 5688 patients, there were 303 deaths from any cause. One hundred and eighty-five (61%) of these deaths occurred in the hormonal therapy group, and 118 (39%) deaths occurred in the radiotherapy plus hormonal therapy group. The mean survival time in the radiotherapy plus hormonal therapy group was 5.32 ± 1.86 years compared with 4.92 ± 1.86 years in the hormonal therapy group. Based on the adjusted and propensity score matching analysis, patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group had a lower risk of death compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy. Radiotherapy plus hormonal therapy decreased the risk of death by 32%. The effect estimates were similar in the adjusted and matched cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy plus hormonal therapy resulted in a significant improvement in the OS of elderly women diagnosed with HR+ BC. © 2018 The Authors.

examined the associations between germline variants and breast cancer mortality using a large meta-analysis of women of European ancestry. Methods: Meta-analyses included summary estimates based on Cox models of twelve datasets using ~10.4 million variants for 96,661 women with breast cancer and 7697 events (breast cancer-specific deaths). Oestrogen receptor (ER)-specific analyses were based on 64,171 ER-positive (4116) and 16,172 ER-negative (2125) patients. We evaluated the probability of a signal to be a true positive using the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP). Results: We did not find any variant associated with breast cancer-specific mortality at P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 . For ER-positive disease, the most significantly associated variant was chr7:rs4717568 (BFDP = 7%, P = 1.28 × 10 −7 , hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84–0.92); the closest gene is AUTS2. For ER-negative disease, the most significant variant was chr7:rs67918676 (BFDP = 11%, P = 1.38 × 10 −7 , HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.16–1.39); located within a long intergenic non-coding RNA gene (AC004009.3), close to the HOXA gene cluster. Conclusions: We uncovered germline variants on chromosome 7 at BFDP &lt; 15% close to genes for which there is biological evidence related to breast cancer outcome. However, the paucity of variants associated with mortality at genome-wide significance underpins the challenge in providing genetic-based individualised prognostic information for breast cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article in Press",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061925826

Methods: Participants were surveyed about communication and decision-making preferences related to genome sequencing results and factors that may affect these preferences. The primary outcome was decision role preference (Control Preference Scale) for selecting what results to receive within medical care or within a research study. Results: For results returned as part of medical care, most patients preferred a collaborative (N = 481, 45%) or active (N = 488, 45%) role with only 107 (10%) choosing a passive role. When making the decision as part of a research study, most patients preferred an active role (N = 617, 57%), 350 (33%) choosing a collaborative role, and110 (10%) choosing a passive role. Conclusion: Most women in this study preferred to share in decision making.

We investigated use of mastectomy as treatment for early breast cancer in the US and applied the resulting information to estimate the minimum and maximum rates at which mastectomy could plausibly be undergone by patients with overdiagnosed breast cancer. Little is currently known about overtreatments undergone by overdiagnosed patients. Methods. In the US, screening is often recommended at ages ≥40. The study population was women age ≥40 diagnosed with breast cancer in the US SEER 9 cancer registries during 2013 (n=26,017). We evaluated first-course surgical treatments and their associations with case characteristics. Additionally, a model was developed to estimate probability of mastectomy conditional on observed case characteristics. The model was then applied to evaluate possible rates of mastectomy in overdiagnosed patients. To obtain minimum and maximum plausible rates of this overtreatment, we respectively assumed the cases that were least and most likely to be treated by mastectomy had been overdiagnosed. Results. Of women diagnosed with breast cancer at age ≥40 in 2013, 33.8% received mastectomy. Mastectomy was common for most investigated breast cancer types, including for the early breast cancers among which overdiagnosis is thought to be most widespread: mastectomy was undergone in 26.4% of in situ and 28.0% of AJCC stage-I cases. These rates are substantively higher than in many European nations. The probability-based model indicated that between >0% and <18% of the study population could plausibly have undergone mastectomy for overdiagnosed cancer. This range reduced depending on the overdiagnosis rate, shrinking to >0% and <7% if 10% of breast cancers were overdiagnosed and >3% and <15% if 30% were overdiagnosed. Conclusions. Screening-Associated overtreatment by mastectomy is considerably less common than overdiagnosis itself but should not be assumed to be negligible. Screening can prompt or prevent mastectomy, and the balance of this harm-benefit tradeoff is currently unclear. © 2019 C. Harding et al.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061338757

We evaluated differences in overall survival (OS) according to age and disease subtype among patients with stage IV breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, we identified 6,302 patients aged &lt; 60 years with de novo stage IV breast cancer between 2010 and 2014. We examined age-specific OS among hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR + )/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (HER2 − ), HR + /HER2-positive (HER2 + ), HR-negative (HR − )/HER2 + , and triple-negative cases using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic variables.

To address this problem, previous studies suggested some criteria for describing the variations appearance of tumor cells relative to normal cells. However, these criteria were still assessed subjectively by pathologists. Previous studies used quantitative computer-extracted features for scoring. However, application of these tools is limited as further improvement in their accuracy is required. This study proposes COMPASS (COMputer-assisted analysis combined with Pathologist’s ASSessment) for reproducible nuclear atypia scoring. COMPASS relies on both cytological criteria assessed subjectively by pathologists as well as computer-extracted textural features. Using machine learning, COMPASS combines these two sets of features and output nuclear atypia score. COMPASS’s performance was evaluated using 300 images for which expert-consensus derived reference nuclear pleomorphism scores were available, and they were scanned by two scanners from different vendors. A personalized model was built for three pathologists who gave scores to six atypia-related criteria for each image. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used. COMPASS was trained and tested for each pathologist separately. Percentage agreement between COMPASS and the reference nuclear scores was 93.8%, 92.9%, and 93.1% for three pathologists. COMPASS’s performance in nuclear grading was almost identical for both scanners, with Cohen’s kappa ranging from 0.80 to 0.86 for different pathologists and different scanners. Independently, the images were also assessed by two experienced senior pathologists. Cohen’s kappa of COMPASS was comparable to the Cohen’s kappa for two senior pathologists (0.79 and 0.68). © 2019, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061202358

With scarce research, it is unclear whether breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is equivalent to mastectomy in men. We sought to compare overall survival (OS) among male breast cancer patients who underwent BCT versus mastectomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 8445 stage I–II (T1–2 N0–1 M0) male breast cancer patients from the National Cancer Database (2004–2014). Patients were grouped according to surgical and radiation therapy (RT). BCT was defined as partial mastectomy followed by RT. Multivariable and inverse probability of treatment-weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare OS between treatment groups, controlling for demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics. Results: Most patients underwent total mastectomy (61.2%), whereas 18.2% underwent BCT, 12.4% underwent total mastectomy with RT, and 8.2% underwent partial mastectomy alone. In multivariable and IPTW models, partial mastectomy alone, total mastectomy alone, and total mastectomy with RT were associated with worse OS compared with BCT (p < 0.001 all). Ten-year OS was 73.8% for BCT and 56.3, 58.0 and 56.3% for other treatment approaches. Older age, higher T/N stage, histological grade, and triple-negative receptor status were associated with poorer OS (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis by stage demonstrated similar results. Conclusions: In this national sample of male breast cancer patients, BCT was associated with greater survival. The underlying mechanisms of this association warrant further study, because more routine adoption of BCT in male breast cancer appears to translate into clinically meaningful improvements in survival. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061757683

Methods: A printed survey was used to solicit feedback on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) during the 5th week of EBT. An open-ended question inquired which DLQI-related issue was most important and why. A directed qualitative content analysis was conducted on the narrative responses. Results: Twenty-eight women provided a response to the ""most important"" question. Sixty narratives led to the identification of 35 codes and six themes during content analysis. Themes included perspectives on having radiodermatitis, sensations caused by radiodermatitis, knowledge, and preparation for radiotherapy, prevention of radiodermatitis, emotions induced by skin changes, and physical appearance of the breast skin. Conclusions: The study results provide a glimpse into the perceptions of skin-related QOL among community-dwelling women who experienced breast radiodermatitis. Some women expressed that radiodermatitis had a profound impact on their QOL while other were surprised that EBT was easy compared to chemotherapy. Our findings parallel those found in a previous study conducted in an urban setting. Results provide insight into the thoughts and needs of women undergoing breast EBT.

Mir-196a is transcribed from two loci and has been implicated in a wide range of developmental and pathogenic processes, with targets including Hox, Fox, Cdk inhibitors and annexins. Genetic variants and altered expression of MIR196A are associated with risk and progression of multiple cancers including breast cancer, however little is known about the regulation of the genes encoding this miRNA, nor the impact of variants therein. Methods: Genomic data and chromatin interaction analysis were used to discover functional promoter and enhancer elements for MIR196A. Expression data were used to associate MIR196A with mechanisms of resistance, breast cancer subtypes and prognosis. Results: Here we demonstrate that MIR196A displays complex and dynamic expression patterns, in part controlled by long-range transcriptional regulation between promoter and enhancer elements bound by ERα. Expression of this miRNA is significantly increased in drug-resistant models of hormone-receptor positive disease. The expression of MIR196A also proves to be a robust prognostic factor for patients with advanced and post-menopausal ER+ disease.

CTC clusters were less frequently detected but more metastatic than single CTCs of patients with triple-negative breast cancer and representative patient-derived xenograft models. Using intravital multiphoton microscopic imaging, we found that clustered tumor cells in migration and circulation resulted from aggregation of individual tumor cells rather than collective migration and cohesive shedding. Aggregated tumor cells exhibited enriched expression of the breast cancer stem cell marker CD44 and promoted tumorigenesis and polyclonal metastasis. Depletion of CD44 effectively prevented tumor cell aggregation and decreased PAK2 levels. The intercellular CD44–CD44 homophilic interactions directed multicellular aggregation, requiring its N-terminal domain, and initiated CD44–PAK2 interactions for further activation of FAK signaling. Our studies highlight that CD44+ CTC clusters, whose presence is correlated with a poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer, can serve as novel therapeutic targets of polyclonal metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: CTCs not only serve as important biomarkers for liquid biopsies, but also mediate devastating metastases. CD44 homophilic interactions and subsequent CD44–PAK2 interactions mediate tumor cluster aggregation.

Trace element levels in toenails are potentially useful biomarkers of exposure, but their reliability is not established. We assessed the reproducibility of toenail element concentrations over time and whether concentrations change following a breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We assessed trace element levels in toenails collected at two time points from 221 women (111 with and 110 without an intervening breast cancer diagnosis). We measured levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium, tin, vanadium, and zinc using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in samples collected at baseline and 4-10 years later. We compared trace element concentrations over time using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (R). We used linear models to examine the magnitude and direction of changes and the influence of a breast cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Overall, we observed positive correlations (R = 0.18-0.71) between paired samples for all trace elements. However, nickel (R = -0.02) and antimony (R = 0.12) were not correlated among cases. We observed decreases in cadmium, chromium, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and lead between baseline and follow-up, but case status was unrelated to these changes. The declines are consistent with decreases over calendar time rather than age time. CONCLUSIONS: Toenail trace element concentrations were correlated over time, but many elements showed systematic decreases by calendar year. Aside from nickel and antimony, postdiagnostic toenail levels correlated with prediagnostic levels, providing support for using postdiagnostic toenail samples in retrospective studies.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057538350

Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study based on the SEER database was conducted to identify patients with de novo stage IV BC diagnosed between 2010 and 2015. Patients were divided into surgery and non-surgery group, and propensity score weighting was used to balance clinicopathologic factors between groups. Results: Of 8142 de novo stage IV BC patients, 1891 (23%) cases were managed with surgery and 6251 (77%) cases were managed without surgery. There were 3821 all-cause deaths and 3291 BC specific deaths over a median follow-up of 22 months. The weighted 3-year overall survival (OS) for the surgery group was 54.5%, compared to 47.7% (P &lt; 0.001) for the non-surgery group. The magnitude of the survival difference with surgery was significantly correlated with metastatic patterns (P interaction &lt;0.05). Significant survival improvements in surgery group compared with non-surgery group were observed in patients with bone-only metastasis (adjusted HR = 0.83, P &lt; 0.05) or multiple metastases with bone involved (adjusted HR = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05), whereas survival inferiority of surgery was found for patients with multiple visceral organs-only metastases (adjusted HR = 2.08, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The survival benefit offered by surgery for de novo stage IV BC varies by metastatic patterns. Decisions for primary surgery of de novo stage IV BC patients should be tailored according to metastatic pattern. © 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062222279

Objective: This phase 1/2 study evaluated the activity of alisertib in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with breast (phase 1) and ovarian cancer (phase 1 and phase 2). Design, Setting, and Participants: An open-label phase 1 and randomized phase 2 clinical trial conducted from April 16, 2010, for phase 1 and March 28, 2012, to August 12, 2013, for phase 2 was conducted at 33 sites (United States, France, and Poland). Data are reported from a cutoff date of August 12, 2014, with a median duration of follow-up of 7.2 months in the alisertib plus paclitaxel arm and 4.6 months in the paclitaxel arm. A total of 191 women with advanced breast (phase 1 only) or recurrent ovarian cancer were enrolled, including 142 patients randomized to alisertib plus paclitaxel (n = 73) or paclitaxel alone (n = 69) in the phase 2 study. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 stratified by platinum-free interval (refractory, 0-6 months, 6-12 months) and prior weekly taxane treatment (yes, no) to receive alisertib 40 mg twice per day orally and 3 days on and 4 days off for 3 weeks, plus paclitaxel (60 mg/m 2 intravenously, days 1, 8, and 15), or weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 intravenously in 28-day cycles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary endpoint was PFS; primary efficacy analysis and safety analysis used modified intention to treat (mITT) population (all randomized patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug). Results: The median age for the 191 patients enrolled in phase 1 was 59 (range, 29-75) years. The median age for the 142 patients enrolled in phase 2 was 63 (range, 30-81) years for patients receiving alisertib plus paclitaxel and 61 (range, 41-81) years for patients receiving paclitaxel. At data cutoff, 107 (75%) patients had a documented PFS event; 52 (71%) in the alisertib plus paclitaxel arm, and 55 (80%) in the paclitaxel arm. Median PFS was 6.7 months with alisertib plus paclitaxel vs 4.7 months with paclitaxel (HR, 0.75; 80% CI, 0.58-0.96; P =.14; 2-sided P value cutoff =.20 to be considered worthy of further investigation). Drug-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 63 (86%) vs 14 (20%) patients in the alisertib plus paclitaxel and paclitaxel arms, including 56 (77%) vs 7 (10%) neutropenia, 18 (25%) vs 0 stomatitis, and 10 (14%) vs 2 (3%) anemia; 54 (74%) vs 17 (25%) had adverse events leading to dose reductions. Two patients died during the study (1 in each arm); neither death was considered related to study drug. Conclusions and Relevance: The primary endpoint, PFS, significantly favored alisertib plus paclitaxel over paclitaxel alone. Further investigation is warranted.

Given that genomic alterations develop as acquired resistance to endocrine therapy, studies on refractory ILC are needed. Patients and methods: Tissue from 336 primary-enriched, breast-biopsied ILC and 485 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive IDC and metastatic biopsy specimens from 180 ILC and 191 ER-positive IDC patients was assayed with hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling for short variant, indel, copy number variants, and rearrangements in up to 395 cancer-related genes. Results: Whereas ESR1 alterations are enriched in the metastases of both ILC and IDC compared with breast specimens, NF1 alterations are enriched only in ILC metastases (mILC). NF1 alterations are predominantly under loss of heterozygosity (11/14, 79%), are mutually exclusive with ESR1 mutations [odds ratio ¼ 0.24, P < 0.027] and are frequently polyclonal in ctDNA assays. Assessment of paired specimens shows that NF1 alterations arise in the setting of acquired resistance. An in vitro model of CDH1 mutated ER-positive breast cancer demonstrates that NF1 knockdown confers a growth advantage in the presence of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. Our study further identified a significant increase in tumor mutational burden (TMB) in mILCs relative to breast ILCs or metastatic IDCs (8.9% >20 mutations/mb; P < 0.001). Most TMB-high mILCs harbor an APOBEC trinucleotide signature (14/16; 88%). Conclusions: This study identifies alteration of NF1 as enriched specifically in mILC. Mutual exclusivity with ESR1 alterations, polyclonality in relapsed ctDNA, and de novo acquisition suggest a role for NF1 loss in endocrine therapy resistance. Since NF1 loss leads to RAS/RAF kinase activation, patients may benefit from a matched inhibitor. Moreover, for an independent subset of mILC, TMB was elevated relative to breast ILC, suggesting possible benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. © The Author(s) 2018.

Insulin plays a role in CD8+ T cells (CD8T) differentiation and function and affects adipocytokines levels. CD8T activity in BrCA is associated with favorable outcome; while PD1 and TIM3 are markers of CD8T exhaustion and play critical roles in the negative regulation of T cell responses. Patients with (BrCA) have high expression levels of PD1 on circulating. Therefore, we hypothesized that BrCA and IR could affect PD1 and/or TIM3 expression on circulating CD8T. We determine PD1 and TIM3 expression on CD8T and analyze the relationship of CD8T phenotype with serum insulin and plasma adipocytokines levels in the different groups. We enrolled four groups of treatment-naive patients: women without neoplasms (Neo-)/without IR (IR-), Neo−/with IR (IR+), BrCa/IR- and BrCa/IR+. We found interactions between BrCA and IR with respect to TIM3 on naïve and central memory (CM) CD8T subsets. Furthermore, BrCA had a greater PD1 + TIM3- CD8T frequency in CD8T subsets than Neo-. IR+ presented a significantly lower PD1 + TIM3- frequency in CD8T subsets compare to Non-IR. In addition, we found a negative correlation between insulin levels, HOMA and frequency of PD1 + TIM3- in CD8T and a positive correlation between adiponectin levels and the frequency PD1 + TIM3- in CD8T. The increased expression of PD1 on different subsets of CD8T from BrCa patients is consistent with immunological tolerance, whereas IR has a contrary effect. IR could have a deleterious role in the activation of CD8T that can be relevant to new BrCa immunotherapy. © 2019, Arányi Lajos Foundation.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061691651

Pathogenic germline mutations in these two genes disrupt their function, lead to genome instability and increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA mutations have been extensively screened in Caucasian populations, and the resulting information are used globally as the standard reference in clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of BRCA-related cancers. Recent studies suggest that BRCA mutations can be ethnic-specific, raising the question whether a Caucasian-based BRCA mutation information can be used as a universal standard worldwide, or whether an ethnicity-based BRCA mutation information system need to be developed for the corresponding ethnic populations. In this study, we used Chinese population as a model to test ethnicity-specific BRCA mutations considering that China has one of the latest numbers of breast cancer patients therefore BRCA mutation carriers. Through comprehensive data mining, standardization and annotation, we collected 1,088 distinct BRCA variants derived from over 30,000 Chinese individuals, one of the largest BRCA data set from a non-Caucasian population covering nearly all known BRCA variants in the Chinese population (https://dbBRCA-Chinese.fhs.umac.mo). Using this data, we performed multi-layered analyses to determine the similarities and differences of BRCA variation between Chinese and non-Chinese ethnic populations. The results show the substantial differences of BRCA data between Chinese and non-Chinese ethnicities. Our study indicates that the current Caucasian population-based BRCA data is not adequate to represent the BRCA status in non-Caucasian populations. Therefore, ethnic-based BRCA standards need to be established to serve for the non-Caucasian populations. © 2019 The Authors.

Its disease progression and treatment obstacle is associated with the negligible expression of estrogen receptors (ER − ), progesterone receptors (PR − ), and HER2 (HER2 − ). Due to a lack of growth hormone receptors, TNBC is desperately demanding effective therapeutic regimens. A growing body of evidence indicated that glycoprotein 130 kDa (GP130), the pivotal mediator involved in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways, is strongly correlated with tumor progression. Therefore, GP130 could become a novel target for treating TNBC. In our earlier studies, we demonstrated bazedoxifene as being a novel GP130 inhibitor. Methods: In the current report, anti-tumor effect of bazedoxifene on TNBC was further evaluated in TNBC cell lines SUM159, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468. We assessed anti-TNBC potency of bazedoxifene by carrying out various analysis encompassing western blot, cell proliferation, cell migration, colony formation, and growth of tumors in the xenograft mice. Results: Our findings demonstrated that bazedoxifene not only decreased the expression of P-STAT3, IL-6/GP130-mediated downstream target genes P-AKT and P-ERK, but also blocked mitogen effects stimulated by IL-6, including cell viability, and overall cell survive, proliferation as well as cell migration. Likewise in laboratory animal model, tumor growth in mice was remarkably suppressed by bazedoxifene via an oral administration route. Combinational treatment of bazedoxifene plus the conventional chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, synergistically impeded cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration far more significantly than the one from single-drug alone. Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that bazedoxifene may be developed as a promising small molecular therapeutic agent for eradicating TNBC intrinsically associated with constitutively active IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling cascade. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062657949

Although Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) is one of the most important oncogenes contributing to tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance in TNBC, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Emerging evidence indicates that autophagy plays a critical role in cell survival and protective mechanism in TNBC. However, signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of autophagy remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the role of FOXM1 in regulating autophagy in TNBC cells and found that FOXM1 is upregulated during induction of autophagy. We found that inhibition of FOXM1 suppressed starvation and rapamycin-induced autophagy and expression of the major autophagy regulators, LC3 and Beclin-1. Further studies demonstrated that FOXM1 directly binds to the promotors of LC3 and Beclin-1 genes and transcriptionally regulates their expression by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase gene reporter assays. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence about the role of FOXM1 in regulating expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 and autophagy in TNBC cells. Our findings provide novel insight into the role of FOXM1 regulation of the autophagic survival pathway and potential molecular target for treating TNBC. Key messages: • FOXM1 promotes tumorigenesis and progression of TNBC. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which FOXM1 promotes TNBC tumorigenesis is unclear. The goal of our study was to determine the role of FOXM1 in the regulation of autophagy that plays a role in TNBC progression. Our findings show that FOXM1 binds to promoters of the genes encoding the major autophagy proteins, Beclin and LC3, and provide new insights into the regulation of autophagy, which is being targeted in many clinical trials. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061312771

Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review on 118 patients over the age of 70 years diagnosed with breast cancer and pathologically proven axillary disease over an 8-year period at an urban academic hospital and compared BMI to treatment received, clinical stage, and hormone receptor status. Results: Performance of radiation therapy, axillary surgery, and chemotherapy was compared in the elderly population over lower and higher BMI, and no significant difference was detected. Although there was a trend for increasing clinical stage to be associated with a lower BMI, this was not statistically significant (P =.06). Conclusion: Obesity does not appear to influence treatment decisions in patients over the age of 70 years. Breast cancer providers should turn to other patient and clinical factors when deciding treatment plans in this patient population.

However, precise estimates of the fraction of nonprogressive cancers remain elusive. In recognition of the weaknesses of overdiagnosis estimation methods based on excess incidence, there is a need for model-based approaches that accommodate nonprogressive lesions. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of a generalized model of breast cancer natural history that allows for a mixture of progressive and indolent lesions. We provide a formal proof of global structural identifiability of the model and use simulation to identify conditions that allow for parameter estimates that are sufficiently precise and practically actionable. We show that clinical follow-up after the last screening can play a critical role in ensuring adequately precise identification of the fraction of indolent cancers in a stop-screen trial design, and we demonstrate that model misspecification can lead to substantially biased estimates of mean sojourn time. Finally, we illustrate our findings using the example of Canadian National Breast Screening Study 2 (1980-1985) and show that the fraction of indolent cancers is not precisely identifiable.

We sought to determine whether uptake differed by risk factors, and to identify reasons for refusal and termination. Methods: Women seen in a high-risk clinic from October 2014 to June 2017 considered eligible for chemoprevention (history of lobular carcinoma in situ, atypia, family history of breast/ovarian cancer, genetic mutation, or history of chest wall radiation) were retrospectively identified. Breast cancer risk factors were compared among those with and without chemoprevention use, and compliance was noted. Results: Overall, 1506 women were identified, 24% with prior/current chemoprevention use. Women ≥ 50 years of age were more likely to use chemoprevention than women < 50 years of age (28% vs. 11%, p < 0.001). Chemoprevention use by risk factor ranged from 7 to 40%. Having multiple risk factors did not increase use. Significant variation by risk factor was present among women ≥ 50 years of age (p < 0.001), but not among women < 50 years of age (p = 0.1). Among women with a documented discussion regarding chemoprevention (575/1141), fear of adverse effects was the most common refusal reason (57/156; 36%). The majority of women (61%) who initiated chemoprevention completed 5 years. Conclusion: Chemoprevention use among women at increased risk for breast cancer remains low, with more frequent use among women ≥ 50 years of age. These data highlight the need for ongoing educational efforts and counseling, as the majority who begin therapy complete 5 years of use. Given the fear of adverse effects as well as low uptake, particularly among women < 50 years of age, alternative risk-reducing strategies are needed. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062003542

Little is known regarding the size and stage of breast cancer types detected and their association with age and breast density. Objective: To determine whether screening examinations using DBT detect breast cancers that are associated with an improved prognosis and to compare the detection rates by patient age and breast density. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective analysis of prospective cohort data from 3 research centers in the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening Through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium included data of women aged 40 to 74 years who underwent screening examinations using DM and DBT from January 1, 2011, through September 30, 2014. Statistical analysis was performed from November 8, 2017, to August 14, 2018. Exposures: Use of DBT as a supplement to DM at breast cancer screening examination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Recall rate, cancer detection rate, positive predictive value, biopsy rate, and distribution of invasive cancer subtypes. Results: Among 96269 women (mean [SD] patient age for all examinations, 55.9 [9.0] years), patient age was 56.4 (9.0) years for DM and 54.6 (8.9) years for DBT. Of 180340 breast cancer screening examinations, 129369 examinations (71.7%) used DM and 50971 examinations (28.3%) used DBT. Screening examination with DBT (73 of 99 women [73.7%]) was associated with the detection of smaller, more often node-negative, HER2-negative, invasive cancers compared with DM (276 of 422 women [65.4%]). Screening examination with DBT was also associated with lower recall (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57-0.72; P <.001) and higher cancer detection (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.89; P =.02) compared with DM for all age groups even when stratified by breast density. The largest increase in cancer detection rate and the greatest shift toward smaller, node-negative invasive cancers detected with DBT was for women aged 40 to 49 years. For women aged 40 to 49 years with nondense breasts, the cancer detection rate for examinations using DBT was 1.70 per 1000 women higher compared with the rate using DM; for women with dense breasts, the cancer detection rate was 2.27 per 1000 women higher for DBT. For these younger women, screening with DBT was associated with only 7 of 28 breast cancers (25.0%) categorized as poor prognosis compared with 19 of 47 breast cancers (40.4%) when screening with DM. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that screening with DBT is associated with increased specificity and an increased proportion of breast cancers detected with better prognosis compared with DM. In the subgroup of women aged 40 to 49 years, routine DBT screening may have a favorable risk-benefit ratio.. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

Women with mBC may take medications that can increase the risk of drug-induced toxicities, including prolongation of cardiac repolarization (prolongation of QT interval). Corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, a toxicity associated with many cancer treatments, can lead to potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. As such, it is important to identify patients at risk for QTc prolongation due to comorbid conditions, concomitant medications, or electrolyte abnormalities. This real-world study estimated the proportion of women with hormone receptor‒positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‒negative (HER2‒) mBC who may be at risk of developing QTc prolongation. Results in the elderly are also included. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study used the Truven Health MarketScan and Optum Clinformatics administrative claims databases. Patients’ medical and pharmacy data were evaluated to assess the risk of QTc prolongation. Prescription and medication administration claims were evaluated during the 7-day period before the index date (ie, first secondary neoplasm diagnosis). In addition, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes were evaluated 12 months before the index date to describe congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte abnormalities. Findings: A cohort of 24,340 women with HR+/HER2‒ mBC were identified, including 5059 women aged 65–74 years and 4851 aged ≥75 years. Based on an overall analysis of risk factors (congenital long QT syndrome, cardiovascular disease, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant medications), 29.5% of all patients, 33.2% of patients aged 65–74 years, and 40.5% of patients aged ≥75 years had risk factors for QTc prolongation. Implications: This analysis of real-world data indicates that almost 1 in 3 women with HR+/HER2‒ mBC had congenital long QT syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and/or electrolyte abnormalities or received a concomitant medication that could increase the risk of developing QTc prolongation. The risk factors for congenital long QT syndrome, cardiovascular disease, or electrolyte abnormalities were more common in older patients. This analysis emphasizes the importance of individualized benefit/risk assessment during treatment decisions, especially when considering drugs with known or possible QTc prolongation risk.

We sought to evaluate the patterns and predictors of provider follow-up care within the first 5 years after diagnosis. METHODS Using the SEER-Medicare linked data set, we evaluated patients who were diagnosed with stage I and II breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery from 2002 to 2007 with follow-up until 2012. We defined discontinuation of follow-up as . 12 months from the previous physician visit without a visit claim from either a surgeon, medical oncologist, or radiation oncologist. We performed a multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine factors associated with the discontinuation of follow-up care. RESULTS Of the 30,053 patients enrolled in our initial cohort, 25,781 (85.8%) saw a medical oncologist and 21,612 (71.9%) saw a radiation oncologist in the first year in addition to a surgeon. Over the 5 years, 6,302 patients (21.0%) discontinued follow-up visits. Discontinuation of physician visits increased with increasing age. Women with stage II cancer (v stage I) were less likely to discontinue follow-up visits (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.83). Time to early discontinuation was greater for patients with hormone receptor–negative tumors (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.24). Women who were diagnosed more recently were less likely to discontinue seeing any physician. CONCLUSION Twenty-one percent of patients with early-stage breast cancer discontinued seeing any oncology provider over the 5 years after diagnosis. Coordination of follow-up care between oncology specialists may reduce discontinuation rates and increase clinical efficiency. © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology","Final",,2-s2.0-85059829047

This observation prompted a multilevel examination of factors that might account for the disparity, with the goal of identifying potential policy interventions that might meaningfully address it Methods: In the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago study, 411 NHblack, 397 NHwhite, and 181 Hispanic patients diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 79 were interviewed, and medical records were abstracted for information on screening and diagnostic follow-up. We conducted a multilevel analysis to assess the role of neighborhood context, patient resources, facility characteristics, and mode of detection in determining the disparity in later stage at diagnosis. Results: After adjustment for neighborhood context, mode of detection, and facility accreditation/resources, there was no significant disparity in later stage breast cancer diagnosis between NHblack or Hispanic patients compared with NHwhite patients. Conclusions: The results suggest that racial/ethnic differences in mode of detection and facility accreditation/resources account for most of the disparity in stage at diagnosis. Understanding the causes of differential screen detection and access to highly accredited facilities could inform interventions to meaningfully address this disparity. Impact: Multilevel approaches to studying health disparities are becoming the research standard for understanding and addressing health disparities.

Indocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA-approved, inexpensive, and widely available NIR dye. We hypothesized that axillary lymphatic mapping with ICG is equivalent to lymphatic mapping with technetium 99m ( 99m Tc) in breast cancer patients. Study Design: Breast cancer patients (cT1-2, N0) were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent lymphatic mapping with 99m Tc preoperatively and ICG mapping intraoperatively (0.8 mL). Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was guided by NIR camera and gamma probe. Rate of failed mapping, number of SLNs identified, and rate of identifying pathologically positive SLNs were compared between the 2 techniques (p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant). Results: Ninety-two female patients were enrolled (median age 59 years). Mean transit time from ICG injection in the breast to localization in the axilla was 5 minutes (range 2 to 29 minutes). No adverse reactions to ICG were noted. Mean number of SLNs identified with ICG and 99m Tc was 2.4 (SD 1.42) and 2.2 (SD 1.23), respectively (p = 0.34). Pathologically positive SLNs were identified in 18 (19.8%) patients. A total of 24 pathologically positive SLNs in 18 patients were identified by ICG in 24 of 24 (100%) patients and by 99m Tc in 23 of 24 (96%) patients (p = 0.99). Conclusions: Indocyanine green with NIR fluorescence imaging can be safely and efficiently used for real-time intraoperative lymphatic mapping in breast cancer patients.

Its safety and clinical activity in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) has not been reported. Objective: To evaluate the safety, clinical activity, and biomarkers associated with the use of single-agent atezolizumab in patients with mTNBC. Design, Setting, and Participants: Women with mTNBC (defined by investigator assessment) were enrolled between January 2013 and February 2016 in a multicohort open-label, phase 1 study at US and European academic medical centers. Median follow-up was 25.3 months (range, 0.4-45.6 months). Eligible patients regardless of line of therapy had measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1; and a representative tumor sample for assessment of immune cell (IC) PD-L1 expression. Interventions: Atezolizumab was given intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxic effects or loss of clinical benefit. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Activity and exploratory outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Outcomes were assessed in all patients and in key patient subgroups. Results: Among 116 evaluable patients (median age, 53 years [range, 29-82 years]), treatment-related adverse events occurred in 73 (63%); 58 (79%) were grade 1 to 2. Most adverse events occurred within the first treatment year. The ORRs were numerically higher in first-line (5 of 21 [24%]) than in second-line or greater patients (6 of 94 [6%]). Median duration of response was 21 months (range, 3 to ≥38 months). Median PFS was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.3-1.6) months by RECIST and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.5) months by irRC. In first-line patients, median OS was 17.6 months (95% CI, 10.2 months to not estimable). Patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 1% tumor-infiltrating ICs had higher ORRs and longer OS (12% [11 of 91]; 10.1 [95% CI, 7.0-13.8] months, respectively) than those with less than 1% ICs (0 of 21; 6.0 [95% CI, 2.6-12.6] months, respectively). High levels of ICs (>10%) were independently associated with higher ORRs and longer OS. Conclusions and Relevance: Single-agent atezolizumab was well tolerated and provided durable clinical benefit in patients with mTNBC with stable or responding disease and in earlier lines of treatment.

Using data from nationwide Danish clinical databases, this cohort study investigated whether the inferior prognosis could be explained by SBBC patients having a more aggressive disease, or whether the prognosis could be explained by the fact that they have two simultaneous cancers. Methods: Patients were diagnosed from 1999–2015. The main outcome was excess mortality, subtracting background population mortality from observed mortality. Differences between SBBC and UBC patients were evaluated by rate ratios (RR) and estimated by Poisson regression. Results: In total, 1214 SBBC and 59 177 UBC patients were included. SBBC patients had a significantly higher excess mortality than UBC patients after adjustment for age and period (RR = 1.73; 95% CI:1.44–2.08; p < 0.01) and after adjusting for characteristics of the worst tumour as traditionally done (RR = 1.31; 95% CI:1.08–1.57; p = 0.01). However, adjusting for characteristics of both tumours, using a more advanced competing risks model, no difference was observed (RR = 1.01; 95% CI:0.83–1.22; p = 0.93).

Methods: In the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (BIG 2-06) phase III trial, HER2-positive early breast cancer patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive one year of trastuzumab, lapatinib, their sequence, or their combination. As per study protocol, menopausal status was collected in all patients at random assignment and at week 37 visit. We investigated TRA rates and whether TRA in patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumors would impact disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Landmark and time-dependent modeling were used to account for guarantee-time bias. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: A total of 2862 premenopausal women were included, of whom 1679 (58.7%) had hormone receptor-positive disease. Median age was 43 (interquartile range = 38-47) years. Similar TRA rates were observed in the trastuzumab (72.6%), lapatinib (74.0%), trastuzumab→lapatinib (72.1%), and trastuzumab+lapatinib (74.8%) arms (P = .64). The association between TRA and survival outcomes differed according to hormone-receptor status (Pinteraction for DFS = .007; Pinteraction for OS = .003).

We investigated the cost-utility between LVOS versus MFFR to determine which approach was most cost-effective. Methods: A literature review was performed to calculate probabilities for clinical outcomes for each surgical option (LVOS versus MFFR), and to obtain utility scores that were converted into quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measures for clinical effectiveness. Average Medicare payments were surrogates for cost. A decision tree was constructed and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was used to calculate cost-effectiveness. Results: The decision tree demonstrates associated QALYs and costs with probabilities used to calculate the ICUR of $3699/QALY with gain of 2.7 QALY at an additional cost of $9987 proving that LVOS is a cost-effective surgical option. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that LVOS became cost-ineffective when its clinical effectiveness had a QALY of less than 30.187. Tornado Diagram Analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation supported our conclusion. Conclusion: LVOS is cost-effective when compared to MFFR for the appropriate breast cancer patient.

However, lobular breast cancers are predominantly Luminal A. Both histologic subtypes show distinct relationships with patient and tumor characteristics, but it is unclear if these associations remain after accounting for intrinsic subtype. Methods: Generalized linear models were used to estimate relative frequency differences (RFDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations between age, race, tumor characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA-based intrinsic subtype, TP53 status, and histologic subtype in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS, n = 3,182) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 808). Results: Relative to ductal tumors, lobular tumors were significantly more likely to be Luminal A [CBCS RNA RFD: 44.9%, 95% CI (39.6, 50.1); TCGA: RFD: 50.5%, 95% CI (43.9, 57.1)], were less frequent among young (≤ 50 years) and black women, were larger in size, low grade, less frequently had TP53 pathway defects, and were diagnosed at later stages. These associations persisted among Luminal A tumors (n = 242). Conclusions: While histology is strongly associated with molecular characteristics, histologic associations with age, race, size, grade, and stage persisted after restricting to Luminal A subtype.

Methods: The IntelliCare mental health apps are grounded in evidence-based research in psychology. They have not been examined in cancer populations. This pilot study will adopt a within-subject, pre-post study design to inform a potential phase III randomized controlled trial. A target sample of 50 individuals (with roughly equal numbers of patients and caregivers) at least 18 years of age and fluent in English will be recruited at a US National Cancer Institute designated clinical cancer center. Consent will be obtained in writing and a mobile phone will be provided if needed. Self-report surveys assessing mental health outcomes will be administered at a baseline session and after a 7-week intervention. Before using the apps, participants will receive a 30-min coaching call to explain their purpose and function. A 10-min coaching call 3 weeks later will check on user progress and address questions or barriers to use. Self-report and semistructured interviews with participants at the end of the study period will focus on user experience and suggestions for improving the apps and coaching in future studies.

We have implemented rapid chilling of mastectomy specimens before formalin fixation. Objective.-To evaluate the effects of rapid chilling of breast tissue on subsequent biomarker and molecular testing. Design.-Mastectomy specimens were chilled at -80°C for 20 minutes to facilitate uniform sectioning of tissue at 4-mm intervals and enhance proper fixation and identification of small lesions. The integrity of chilled tissue for ancillary and molecular testing was assessed. We identified patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer on biopsy at outside institutions and subsequently underwent mastectomy at our institution during 2010-2014. We compared the results of biomarker testing performed on biopsy tissue with those performed on mastectomy tissue. The quantity and quality of DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) mastectomy tissue with invasive carcinoma were assessed by using spectrophotometry and polymerase chain reaction. All Oncotype DX reports from 2011- 2014 were reviewed to identify any documented evidence of assay interference caused by rapid chilling of tissue. Results.-We found essentially 100% concordances in estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene ERBB2 (HER2/ neu) studies. Extracted tumor DNA showed suitable purity and concentration that produced amplified fragments of 300 to 400 base pair lengths by polymerase chain reaction of FFPE tissue. No documented assay interferences were found in the Oncotype DX reports. Conclusions.-Short-duration rapid chilling of mastectomy tissue improves gross examination, optimally preserves DNA, allows for molecular testing, and does not interfere with biomarker assessment. © 2019 College of American Pathologists.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the SEER-Medicare linked database in older adults with breast (N = 17,630), prostate (N = N = 18,721), or colorectal cancer (female: N = 5652; male: N = 3768). PIM use was defined based on 2015 Beers Criteria and was measured using prescription claims. Count models were used to examine the association between PIM use and the number of inpatient and ER visits. Generalized linear models were utilized with the log-link function and gamma distribution to analyze associations between PIM use and medical expenditures. The Inverse Treatment Probability Treatment Weights were applied in the analyses. Results: 61.7% of patients with breast cancer, 47.3% of patients with prostate cancer, and 66.3% (females: 68.0%; males: 63.8%) of patients with colorectal cancer were found to use one or more PIM. PIM use was positively associated with number of inpatient visits, number of ER visits, non-drug costs, and total medical costs in all three types of cancer, except for the number of inpatient visits among patients with colorectal cancer. Conclusion: PIM use was significantly associated with greater healthcare utilization and higher healthcare costs in this population.

Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin improves outcomes when used in addition to ET in patients with HR-positive MBC, who previously received ET. We hypothesized that the additional use of trastuzumab (T) or everolimus (E) could restore sensitivity to ET in patients with endocrine-resistant, HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC. Patients and Methods: Patients with endocrine-resistant HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC continued the ET during which they had experienced disease progression, and were randomized to receive T or E. At disease progression, patients could continue the therapy they were receiving and have E or T used in addition. Results: Fifty-four patients were randomized to the additional use of E (n = 30) or T (n = 24) with existing ET. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.7 months, and 2.2 months, respectively, and clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks was 48% and 11% for patients receiving E or T, respectively. PFS was 4.5 months and 3.1 months for patients in whom E (n = 16) or T (n = 12) was used post progression, respectively. There were no new safety signals apart from 2 patients who had a decreased ejection fraction while receiving E with ET. Conclusion: These results suggest that E, but not T, can potentially reverse resistance to ET in patients with endocrine-resistant HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC. Further, the additional use of E with an ET to which the cancer has already been exposed might offer the possibility of delaying time to use of chemotherapy. © 2019 The AuthorsPatients with endocrine-refractory, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer were treated with everolimus (n = 30) or trastuzumab (n = 24) in addition to their existing endocrine therapy.

We set out to characterize this heterogeneous disease by combining transcriptomics and genomics data, with the aim of revealing convergent pathway dependencies with the potential for treatment intervention. A Bayesian algorithm was used to integrate molecular profiles in two TNBC cohorts, followed by validation using five independent cohorts (n ¼ 1,168), including three clinical trials. A four-gene decision tree signature was identified, which robustly classified TNBCs into six subtypes. All four genes in the signature (EXO1, TP53BP2, FOXM1, and RSU1) are associated with either genomic instability, malignant growth, or treatment response. One of the six subtypes, MC6, encompassed the largest proportion of tumors (50%) in early diagnosed TNBCs. In TNBC patients with metastatic disease, the MC6 proportion was reduced to 25%, and was independently associated with a higher response rate to platinum-based chemotherapy. In TNBC cell line data, platinum sensitivity was recapitulated, and a sensitivity to the inhibition of the phosphatase PPM1D was revealed. Molecularly, MC6-TNBCs displayed high levels of telomeric allelic imbalances, enrichment of CD4 þ and CD8 þ immune signatures, and reduced expression of genes negatively regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.

The polymer readily formed micelles that were effective in loading Dox and simultaneously forming complexes with IL-36γ plasmid. Interestingly, particles co-loaded with Dox and plasmid was significantly smaller and more stable than the particles loaded with Dox only. Gene transfection in both lungs and s.c. tumors was significantly higher with our polymer compared to PEI. In addition, the Dox + IL-36γ/POEG-st-Pmor not only could bring improved anti-metastatic effect but synergistically enhance the type I immune response by increasing the IFN-γ positive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and simultaneously decreasing the immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the lung.

RECENT FINDINGS: Until recently, tamoxifen alone was the only recommended adjuvant treatment option for premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive disease. However, recent important evidence has contributed to significantly modify the endocrine treatment landscape in this setting. SUMMARY: With the only exception of patients with low-risk clinical-pathological features characterized by excellent survival outcomes with tamoxifen alone, the use of ovarian function suppression is to be considered standard of care for most of premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive disease. Regarding the choice of its best partner as endocrine agent, the available data suggest that the higher the risk of disease recurrence the larger benefit can be observed with a more profound estrogen deprivation that can be obtained with ovarian function suppression and an aromatase inhibitor as compared to ovarian function suppression and tamoxifen. Despite the significant improvement in our understanding on the role of ovarian function suppression in this setting, several unanswered questions remain and further research efforts are needed in the field.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056821683

In the context of breast cancer, the modified Bloom-Richardson Grading system is highly correlated with the morphological and topological nuclear features are highly correlated with Modified Bloom-Richardson grading. Therefore, to develop a computer-aided prognosis system, automated detection and segmentation of nuclei are critical prerequisite steps. We present a method for automated detection and segmentation of breast cancer nuclei named a convolutional neural network initialized active contour model with adaptive ellipse fitting (CoNNACaeF). The CoNNACaeF model is able to detect and segment nuclei simultaneously, which consist of three different modules: Convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate nuclei detection, (2) region-based active contour (RAC) model for subsequent nuclear segmentation based on the initial CNN-based detection of nuclear patches, and (3) adaptive ellipse fitting for overlapping solution of clumped nuclear regions. The performance of the CoNNACaeF model is evaluated on three different breast histological data sets, comprising a total of 257 H&E-stained images. The model is shown to have improved detection accuracy of F-measure 80.18%, 85.71%, and 80.36% and average area under precision-recall curves (AveP) 77%, 82%, and 74% on a total of 3 million nuclei from 204 whole slide images from three different datasets.

Despite multiple studies on lncRNA functions in tumor pathology, systemic targeting of these ""undruggable"" macromolecules with conventional approaches remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate effective TNBC therapy by nanoparticle-mediated RNAi of the oncogenic lncRNA DANCR, which is significantly overexpressed in TNBC. Tumor-targeting RGD-PEG-ECO/siDANCR nanoparticles were formulated via self-assembly of multifunctional amino lipid ECO, cyclic RGD peptide-PEG, and siDANCR for systemic delivery. MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells treated with the therapeutic RGD-PEG-ECO/siDANCR nanoparticles exhibited 80-90% knockdown in the expression of DANCR for up to 7 days, indicating efficient intracellular siRNA delivery and sustained target silencing. The RGD-PEG-ECO/siDANCR nanoparticles mediated excellent in vitro therapeutic efficacy, reflected by significant reduction in the invasion, migration, survival, tumor spheroid formation, and proliferation of the TNBC cell lines. At the molecular level, functional ablation of DANCR dynamically impacted the oncogenic nexus by downregulating PRC2-mediated H3K27-trimethylation and Wnt/EMT signaling, and altering the phosphorylation profiles of several kinases in the TNBC cells. Furthermore, systemic administration of the RGD-PEG-ECO/siDANCR nanoparticles at a dose of 1 mg/kg siRNA in nude mice bearing TNBC xenografts resulted in robust suppression of TNBC progression with no overt toxic side-effects, underscoring the efficacy and safety of the nanoparticle therapy.

However, a portion of BRCA1 mutation carriers never develops breast cancer throughout their lifetime. This phenomenon is called incomplete penetrance. Genetic factor is proposed to contribute to this phenomenon, but the details regarding the genetic factor remain elusive. BRCA1 mutations were inherited from the ancestors of the mutation carrier families during human evolution, and their presence is a consistent threat to the survival of the mutation carrier population. In the present study, we hypothesize that evolution could positively select genetic components in the mutation carrier population to suppress the oncogenesis imposed by the predisposition. Experimental design: To test our hypothesis, we used whole exome sequencing to compare germline variation of all genes in pairs of breast cancer–unaffected and breast cancer–affected BRCA1 mutation carriers, each pair was from the same family carrying the same BRCA1 mutation. Results: We identified a group of ‘beneficial’ variants enriched in the breast cancer–unaffected carrier group. These were the common variants in human population distributed in multiple genes involved in multiple functionally important pathways. We found a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs3735400 located in ANLN gene, which plays an essential role in controlling cytokinesis and is often found to be overexpressed in cancer. The carriers of this variant had lower cumulative risk of developing breast cancer; overexpression of the variant-containing ANLN decreased ANLN nuclear localization suppressed expression of the variant-containing ANLN, and decreased the cellular proliferation respectively. Conclusion: Our findings support our hypothesis that common genetic variants can be evolutionarily selected in BRCA1 mutation carrier population to counterpart the oncogenic effects imposed by mutation predisposition in BRCA1, contributing to the incomplete penetrance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85058022571

Low levels of nicotine (Nic) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), have been detected in cases of second-hand smoke (SHS). However, the correlation between SHS and BC risk remains controversial. In this study, we investigated whether the physiological SHS achievable dose of Nic and tobacco specific nitrosamine, NNK act together to induce breast carcinogenesis using an in vitro breast cell carcinogenesis model. Immortalized non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, HBL-100 used for a time-course assay, was exposed to very low levels of either Nic or NNK, or both. The time-course assay consisted of 23 cycles of nitrosamines treatment. In each cycle, HBL-100 cells were exposed to 1pM of Nic and/or 100 femtM of NNK for 48 hours. Cells were passaged every 3 days and harvested after 10, 15, and 23 cycles. Our results demonstrated that the tumorigenicity of HBL-100, defined by soft agar colony forming, proliferation, migration and invasion abilities, was enhanced by co-exposure to physiologically SHS achievable doses of Nic and NNK. In addition, α9-nAChR signaling activation, which plays an important role in cellular proliferation and cell survival, was also observed. Importantly, an increase in stemness properties including the prevalence of CD44+/CD24− cells, increase Nanog expression and mammosphere-forming ability were also observed.

Increased expression of type X collagen α-1 (ColXα1) in tumor-associated stroma correlates with poor pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers. Evaluation of ColXα1 expression patterns suggests a potential connection with elastin fibers. To investigate the possible interaction between ColXα1 and elastin, we evaluated the expression of ColXα1 in relation to elastin fibers in normal breast tissue, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive breast carcinomas at cellular and subcellular levels. Our findings demonstrate that ColXα1 colocalizes with elastin in invasive breast cancer-associated stroma by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. In 212 invasive breast carcinomas, this complex was aberrantly and selectively expressed in tumor extracellular matrix in 79% of ER+/HER2-, 80% of ER+/HER2+, 76% of ER-/HER2+, and 58% of triple negative breast cancers. In contrast, ColXα1 was generally absent, while elastin was present perivascularly in normal breast tissue. ColXα1 and elastin were coexpressed in 58% of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in periductal areas. In mass-forming DCIS with desmoplastic stroma, the complex was intensely expressed in periductal areas as well as within the tumor-associated stroma in all cases. Our data suggest that the breast carcinoma neoplastic process may involve aberrant expression of ColXα1 and elastin in the tumor microenvironment emerging early at the DCIS stage. Enrichment of these complexes in tumor-associated stroma may represent a stromal signature indicative of intrinsic differences between breast cancers. These findings shed light on investigation into the role of aberrant collagen complex expression in tumorigenesis and tumor progression which may be leveraged in therapeutic and theranostic applications. © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we established the tumor suppressor function of AnxA6 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by showing that loss of AnxA6 is associated with early onset and rapid growth of xenograft TNBC tumors in mice. We also identified the Ca 2+ activated RasGRF2 as an effector of AnxA6 mediated TNBC cell growth and motility. Activation of Ca 2+ mobilizing oncogenic receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in TNBC cells or pharmacological stimulation of Ca 2+ influx led to activation, subsequent degradation and altered effector functions of RasGRF2. Inhibition of Ca 2+ influx or overexpression of AnxA6 blocked the activation/degradation of RasGRF2. We also show that AnxA6 acts as a scaffold for RasGRF2 and Ras proteins and that its interaction with RasGRF2 is modulated by GTP and/or activation of Ras proteins. Meanwhile, down-regulation of RasGRF2 and treatment of cells with the EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib strongly attenuated the growth of otherwise EGFR-TKI resistant AnxA6 high TNBC cells. These data not only suggest that AnxA6 modulated Ca 2+ influx and effector functions of RasGRF2 underlie at least in part, the AnxA6 mediated TNBC cell growth and/or motility, but also provide a rationale to target Ras-driven TNBC with EGFR targeted therapies in combination with inhibition of RasGRF2. © 2019 Impact Journals LLC.

Results: For all three cancer screenings, the younger sub-groups (average ages 73.4–76.1) had higher screening rates than the older sub-groups (average ages 83.6–86.9); screening rates were 42.9% versus 34.2% for prostate cancer screening (p = 0.02), 33.6% versus 20.6% for breast cancer screening (p < 0.001), 13.1% versus 6.7% for colorectal cancer screening in women (p = 0.006), and 20.5% versus 12.1% for colorectal cancer screening in men (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Among older adults with limited life expectancy, those who are relatively younger with poorer health and functional status are over-screened for cancer at higher rates than those who are older with the same predicted life expectancy. © 2018, Society of General Internal Medicine.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056198872

Materials and Methods: Eligible women ≥50 years of age with ≤2.5-cm, lymph node–negative invasive or in situ breast cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery and placement of a brachytherapy applicator. ICBB was initiated on the second weekday after surgery and prescribed to 21 Gy in 3 once-daily fractions. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0; 10-point linear analog scale assessment; the PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; and the Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale were used for provider and patient-reported assessments. Results: Seventy-three women were treated for invasive (79%) or in situ (21%) breast cancer. The median time to completion of surgery and radiation therapy was 6 days. After 14-months median follow-up, 2 patients (3%) had developed breast infections that resolved with oral antibiotics. There was no other treatment-associated adverse event grade ≥2. The grade 1 seroma rate at 3 months was 20%, which dropped to 8% at 12 months; no events required intervention. At 12 months, 91% of patients reported an overall quality of life score as ≥8 of 10, and patient-reported cosmesis was good or excellent in 95%. All patients are alive without relapse at the last follow-up. Conclusions: Three-fraction ICBB is associated with low rates of early provider and patient- reported adverse events and compares favorably with early outcomes of more protracted ICBB regimens, including twice-daily (3.4 Gy × 10) fractionation studied in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-39.

Presentation of case: We present a rare case of a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of breast cancer who presented with signs and symptoms of appendicitis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed acute appendicitis in addition to a 2.3 cm cecal mass that correlated with a hypermetabolic region on positron emission testing (PET) the previous year. Analysis of a previously biopsied axillary lymph node demonstrated infiltrating ductal carcinoma. After an appendectomy and a right hemicolectomy were performed, pathologic analysis of the specimen revealed metastatic ductal carcinoma to the cecum. Discussion: Gastrointestinal metastases of breast carcinoma are rare with colonic metastases occurring in approximately 3% of these cases. At the time of diagnosis of these colonic metastases, the disease is often times multifocal in the gastrointestinal tract. Solitary gastrointestinal metastases are less common than both secondary primaries and benign processes. Biopsies obtained during colonoscopy are often non-diagnostic, mandating surgical excision and pathologic examination. Conclusion: Although colonic metastases from a primary breast ductal carcinoma are rare, a low level of suspicion must be maintained in a patient with such a history presenting with abdominal symptoms. © 2018 The Author(s)","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85057442420

For example, blacks experience mortality rates up to about 42% higher than whites for these cancers. Furthermore, although overall death rates have been declining, the differential access to screening and care has aggravated disparities. Our purpose is to assess how the coverage policies of CMS and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) influence these disparities. Additionally, barriers are often encountered in accessing screening tests and receiving prompt treatment. To narrow, and potentially eliminate, outcomes disparities, CMS and USPSTF could consider revising their decision-making processes regarding coverage. Some options include (1) extending their evidence base to include observational studies that involve groups at higher risk; (2) lowering the threshold ages for screening to encompass differences in incidence; (3) CMS approving screening CT colonography coverage, which can even increase compliance with other screening tests; (4) clarifying and streamlining guidelines; (5) supporting research on improving access to screening; and (6) encouraging the development of more navigation services for URMs. © 2019 American College of Radiology","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062229218

However, there is a paucity of information regarding tobacco smoke exposure and DNA methylation of breast tumors. Methods: We conducted a case-only analysis using breast tumor tissue from 493 postmenopausal and 225 premenopausal cases in the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) study. Methylation of nine genes (SFN, SCGB3A1, RARB, GSTP1, CDKN2A, CCND2, BRCA1, FHIT, and SYK) was measured with pyrosequencing. Participants reported their secondhand smoke (SHS) and active smoking exposure for seven time periods. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) of having methylation higher than the median. Results: SHS exposure was associated with tumor DNA methylation among postmenopausal but not premenopausal women. Active smoking at certain ages was associated with increased methylation of GSTP1, FHIT, and CDKN2A and decreased methylation of SCGB3A1 and BRCA1 among both pre- and postmenopausal women. Conclusion: Exposure to tobacco smoke may contribute to breast carcinogenesis via alterations in DNA methylation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate craniospinal progression between intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab, IT chemotherapy, and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in leptomeningeal disease. Methods: A total of 56 patients were identified with breast cancer leptomeningeal disease at our institution treated with IT trastuzumab (n = 18; 32%), single-agent IT chemotherapy (methotrexate n = 14 or thiotepa n = 1; 27%), or WBRT alone (n = 23; 41%).

This report summarizes our program's experience developing and implementing PB-IORT. Methods and Materials: Literature on PB-IORT was reviewed including published articles and abstracts. To evaluate case volume, all patients with a breast cancer diagnosis who underwent breast surgery or breast radiation (2010–2017) at our academic institution were identified. Patients were stratified into pre-IORT and post-IORT eras with initiation of our PB-IORT program in October 2013. Overall trends in surgical and radiation therapy volume in each era were analyzed by linear regression. Travel distance for all surgical patients was calculated using Google Maps (Alphabet Inc.) and then compared between IORT and non-IORT patients. Results: Data from a PB-IORT Phase 1 trial found that the primary endpoints were met and that PB-IORT is feasible and safe. The direct health system's delivery costs for PB-IORT exceed those of 16-fraction whole-breast irradiation when accounting for consumable supplies (multilumen balloon applicator = $2,750 per patient). There was a significant increase in yearly growth of breast cancer surgical volume with PB-IORT. Conclusions: Accrual rates for the ongoing Phase II trial have been quicker than expected in an area where more research is needed. The rapid accrual indicates patient interest and demand for this treatment and that it is very feasible to get more data from randomized trials. © 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062298244

Methods and materials: A total of 281 patients with pTis, pT1N0, or pT2N0 (≤3.0 cm) breast cancer treated with segmental mastectomy were prospectively enrolled from December 2008 through August 2014. APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template. Results: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) ≤102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance ≤0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).

More research is needed to understand the impact of this information on women’s perceptions and mammography screening behavior. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted in English and Spanish with 24 self-identified Hispanic women who had undergone at least 1 mammogram since breast density notification was enacted in New York State. The women ranged in age from 43 to 63 years. Women were asked about their understanding and perceptions of the communication of New York State-mandated breast density information, and any actions they have taken or would take in response to this information. A content analysis of the qualitative data from the translated and transcribed interviews was conducted. Results: The majority of participants had no prior knowledge of breast density and expressed confusion and apprehension regarding the meaning of dense breasts when presented with the notification information. Many participants understood having dense breasts to be a serious and abnormal condition, and reported feelings of worry and vulnerability. Participants mostly expressed a strong interest in learning about breast density and obtaining additional and more frequent breast cancer screening tests. These behavioral intentions were consistent with participants’ overall favorable view of breast cancer screening and a belief that their faith, as well as regular screening, can help to protect them from breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the dose delivered to the heart and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in a series of patients with left-sided breast cancer (BC) or ductal carcinoma in situ treated with multicatheter-accelerated partial breast irradiation (MC-APBI) at a single institution. Methods and Materials: Patients with left-sided BC or ductal carcinoma in situ treated consecutively from 2005 to 2011 with MC-APBI were retrospectively identified. Cardiac and LAD contours were generated for each patient. Cardiac dosimetry and distance to the planning target volume were recorded. Patient health records were reviewed and cardiac events were recorded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Results: Twenty consecutive patients with left-sided BC treated with MC-APBI were retrospectively identified. Median followup was 41.4 months. Mean equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions delivered to the heart and LAD were 1.3 (standard deviation: 0.7, range: 0.2–2.9) and 3.8 (standard deviation: 3.0, range: 0.4–11.3) Gy, respectively. There was an inverse linear relationship (R2 = 0.52) between heart-to-lumpectomy cavity distance and mean heart equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions. One patient (5%) experienced symptomatic cardiac toxicity. Conclusions: MC-APBI consistently delivers average doses to the heart and LAD that are similar to those achieved in most series with deep inspiration breath-hold and lower than free-breathing radiotherapy techniques. Distance from the heart to the lumpectomy cavity and the availability of other heart-sparing technologies should be considered to minimize the risk of cardiac toxicity. © 2018 American Brachytherapy Society","Final",,2-s2.0-85053839527

However, this approach has potential shortcomings in patient selection and target volume definition and in dosimetric, radiobiological, and logistical issues. We designed a prospective, phase 2, multi-institution clinical trial to study 2- or 3-day accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered with brachytherapy applicators. Methods and Materials: This trial treats select breast cancers after breast-conserving surgery with brachytherapy applicators that deliver 22.5 Gy in 3 fractions of 7.5 Gy. The planning treatment volume was 1 to 1.5 cm beyond the surgical cavity. Eligible women were aged ≥45 years with unicentric invasive or in situ tumors ≤3.0 cm with positive estrogen or progesterone receptors and no metastasis to axillary nodes that have been excised with negative margins. Strict dosimetric parameters were required to be met before acceptance into the trial. Results: A group of 200 patients was prospectively enrolled and followed for a minimum of 6 months. Two- or 3-day brachytherapy was associated with low acute or subacute toxicity, 97.25% excellent or good cosmetic outcomes, and excellent local control in select breast cancers. Conclusions: Ultrashort breast brachytherapy is dosimetrically feasible and can be delivered with excellent short-term tolerance and low toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061692273

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) has been observed to have decreased response to NCT compared with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). This study seeks to evaluate national trends in the use of NCT for ILC compared with IDC, and determine if there is a subset of ILC patients who demonstrate favorable response rates. Methods: This is a study using the National Cancer Database. The cohort consisted of patients with stage 1-3 ILC treated between 2010 and 2014, and a reference cohort of patient with IDC. For patients receiving NCT, pCR was assessed and clinically relevant variables were used in multivariable logistic regression models for each histologic subtype, modeling for pCR achievement. Survival analysis was performed for each histologic group to evaluate potential survival benefits of achieving pCR. Results: Our study cohort consisted of 384,887 women, of which 9.7% had ILC. A significantly lower rate of pCR after NCT was found in the cases of ILC compared with those of IDC (8.7% versus 23.2%). Increased response was seen in ILC patients with HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes. A survival benefit was demonstrated in patients with ILC who achieved pCR. Conclusions: While response to NCT in patients with ILC is uncommon, our findings demonstrate a selective benefit for patients with HER2-positive tumors and TNBC. In addition, pCR is correlated with a clear survival advantage in ILC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85053765847

NMD collects demographic, imaging, interpretation, biopsy, and basic pathology results, enabling facility and physician comparison for quality improvement. However, NMD lacks treatment and clinical outcomes data. The network of state cancer registries (CRs) contains detailed pathologic, treatment, and clinical outcomes data. This pilot study assessed electronic linkage of NMD and CR data at a multicenter institution as proof of concept. Materials and Methods: We obtained Quality Oversight Committee approval for this retrospective study. Data of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 and 2015 were retrieved from our NMD-approved radiology information system (RIS) and matched with reportable patients in our CR using social security number (SSN), first name (fname), last name (lname), and date of birth (DOB). Matching was repeated without SSN. Percentage and reasons for mismatch were evaluated. Results: The RIS query identified 1,316 patients. CR linkage was 99.2% successful (n = 1,305 of 1,316) using SSN, fname, lname, and DOB. Eleven mismatches included four CR case-finding failures, one NMD fname error, five nonreportable in the CR, and one with correct identifiers in both databases. Without SSN, linkage was 97.3% successful (n = 1,281 of 1,316); name errors accounted for 19 and DOB accounted for 5 additional mismatches. Conclusion: Using common data elements, linkage between the NMD and state CRs may be feasible and could provide critical outcomes information to advance accurate assessment of breast imaging in the United States. © 2018 American College of Radiology","Final",,2-s2.0-85059497655

Limited qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests that there may be latent subgroups of mothers in the United States following very different trajectories of breast milk provision for their infants. This study used a quantitative modelling method (group-based trajectory modelling) to identify and describe these subgroups. Using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (n = 3,023), the authors identified four distinct trajectories of breastfeeding intensity, each of which included a substantial subset of the total sample. A model with four groups fit the data well by objective and conceptual standards. Bivariate associations were analysed, and significant difference between trajectory group membership was found on an array of maternal and family determinants, including maternal demographics, hospital experience, and psychosocial resources, as well as on postweaning perceptions. These associations were used to create group profiles for each subgroup. Controlling for sociodemographic covariates, we also found that trajectory membership was significantly associated with several health outcomes for the target child 6 years later, including certain infections, picky eating, and health care utilization; trajectory group membership was also associated with maternal breastfeeding of subsequent children and maternal body mass index (BMI) at Year 6. Child BMI z-score and maternal breast cancer diagnosis were not significantly different across trajectory groups after accounting for confounding covariates, nor was time missed from school for the target child. Though exploratory, the initial identification and description of these four subgroups suggest future directions using breastfeeding trajectory methods, with potential implications for measurement, intervention development, and targeting. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85053454016

Herein, we sought to understand the molecular underpinnings of the 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) resistance in ILC by assessing the potential role of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL (SNAI1). Methods: Using a series of breast cancer cell lines, we measured the basal, estrogen and 4OHT-induced expression of SNAIL and other EMT-TF family members by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to assess ER binding to the SNAIL promoter. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed in 2D cultures. 3D growth was assessed in Matrigel and Collagen I cultures. Results: Estrogen and 4OHT induced SNAIL expression, but not that of the other EMT-TF family members SLUG (SNAI2) and SMUC (SNAI3), with the 4OHT effect being specific to the lobular but not the ductal subtype. We observed estrogen and 4OHT-induced ER recruitment to the SNAI1 promoter and high endogenous basal levels of SNAIL and several EMT-TFs in ILC cell lines. While SNAIL knockdown had a minor impact on the 4OHT partial agonism in estrogen-depleted conditions, it led to a surprising increase in cell proliferation in full serum. In complementary experiments, inducible SNAI1 overexpression caused decreased proliferation, associated with a cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 . Additionally, apoptosis was observed in BCK4 cells. Conclusion: These data suggest a previously unrecognized role for SNAIL in ILC, substantiating a context-dependent behavior for this EMT-TF. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062019495

HERC4 is a new E3 ligase for the tumor suppressor LATS1 and destabilizes LATS1 by promoting the ubiquitination of LATS1. miRNA-136-5p and miRNA-1285-5p, expression of which is decreased in human breast cancers and is inversely correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients, are directly involved in suppressing the expression of HERC4.

The purpose of this study was to create masking measures and apply them to identify interval risk in a population of women who experienced either screen-detected or interval cancers after controlling for breast density. Methods: We examined full-field digital screening mammograms acquired from 2006 to 2015. Examinations associated with 182 interval cancers were matched to 173 screen-detected cancers on age, race, exam date and time since last imaging examination. Local Image Quality Factor (IQF) values were calculated and used to create IQF maps that represented mammographic masking. We used various statistics to define global masking measures of these maps. Association of these masking measures with interval cancer vs screen-detected cancer was estimated using conditional logistic regression in a univariate and adjusted model for Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density. Receiver operator curves were calculated in each case to compare specificity vs sensitivity, and area under those curves were generated. Proportion of screen-detected cancer was estimated for stratifications of IQF features. Results: Several masking features showed significant association with interval compared to screen-detected cancers after adjusting for BI-RADS density (up to P = 2.52E-6), and the 10th percentile of the IQF value (P = 1.72E-3) showed the strongest improvement in the area under the receiver operator curve, increasing from 0.65 using only BI-RADS density to 0.69. The highest masking group had a 32% proportion of screen-detected cancers while the low masking group had a 69% proportion. Conclusions: We conclude that computer vision methods using model observers may improve quantifying the probability of breast cancer detection beyond using breast density alone. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061592940

The purpose of this study was to develop more potent analogs based upon CPZ pharmacophore and structure–activity relationships (SAR) across analogs. We generated 30 novel compounds and screened for their anti-proliferative effects in cultured HeLa cervical cancer cells. Cell viability assays identified multiple compounds with IC50s &lt; 15 μM and one compound, 29 with an IC50 &lt; 5 μM; six fold more potent than CPZ. We validated the anti-proliferative efficacy of two lead compounds, 17 and 29, in vivo using HeLa-derived xenografts in athymic nude mice. Both analogs significantly reduced tumor volumes by day 8 compared to control treated animals (p &lt; 0.001) with no observable adverse effects. Calcium imaging determined that compound 17 activates TRPV1 whereas 29 neither activates nor inhibits TRPV1; indicating a unique mechanism-of-action that does not involve TRPV1 signaling. Cell viability assays using a panel of additional tumor types including oral squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines (HSC-3, H460, MDA-231, and PC-3 respectively) demonstrated that both lead compounds were efficacious against every cancer type tested. Compounds 29 displayed IC50s of 1–2.5 μM in HSC-3and PC-3cells. Thus, we propose that these novel CPZ analogs may serve as efficacious therapeutic agents against multiple tumor types that warrant further development for clinical application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85057784853

However, as new discoveries portend advancements in technology and risk-based screening, we fail to fulfill the greatest potential of the existing technology, in terms of both full access among the target population and the delivery of state-of-the art care at each crucial step in the cascade of events that characterize successful cancer screening. There also is insufficient commitment to invest in the development of new technologies, incentivize the development of new ideas, and rapidly evaluate promising new technology.

To compare mammography cost sharing between women aged 40 to 49 and those 50 to 74. Methods: We used patient-level analytic files between 2004 and 2014 from Clinformatics Data Mart (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). We included women 40 to 74 years without a history of breast cancer or mastectomy. We conducted an interrupted time series analyses assessing cost sharing and utilization trends before and after the ACA implementation and USPSTF revised guidelines. Results: We identified 1,763,959 commercially insured women aged 40 to 74 years. Between 2004 and 2014, the proportion of women with zero cost share for screening mammography increased from 81.9% in 2004 to 98.2% in 2014, reaching 93.1% with the 2010 ACA implementation. The adjusted median cost share remained $0 over time. Initially at 36.0% in 2004, screening utilization peaked at 42.2% in 2009 with the USPSTF guidelines change, dropping to 40.0% in 2014. Comparing women aged 40 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 to 74, the proportion exposed to cost sharing declined over time in all groups. Conclusions: A substantial majority of commercially insured women had first-dollar coverage for mammography before the ACA. After ACA, nearly all women had access to zero cost-share mammography. The lack of an increase in mammography use post-ACA can be partially attributed to a USPSTF guideline change, the high proportion of women without cost sharing before the ACA, and the relatively low levels of cost sharing before the policy implementation. © 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062221147

Orthotopic mouse models of breast cancer show that β-adrenergic signaling induced by chronic stress accelerates metastasis, and that β2-adrenergic receptors on tumor cells are critical for this. Endogenous catecholamines are released during chronic stress: norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves, and epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. β2-adrenergic receptors are much more sensitive to epinephrine than to norepinephrine. To determine if epinephrine is necessary in the effects of stress on cancer progression, we used a denervation strategy to eliminate circulating epinephrine, and quantified the effect on metastasis. Using both human xenograft and immune-intact murine models of breast cancer, we show that circulating epinephrine is dispensable for the effects of chronic stress on cancer progression. Measured levels of circulating norepinephrine were sufficiently low that they were unlikely to influence β2-adrenergic signaling, suggesting a possible role for norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85053804430

Automation could represent a solution. Here we investigate the reproducibility of Ki67 measurement between three image analysis platforms with supervised classifiers performed by the same operator, by multiple operators, and finally we compare their accuracy in prognostic potential. Two breast cancer patient cohorts were used for this study. The standardization was done with the 30 cases of ER+ breast cancer that were used in phase 3 of International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group initiatives where blocks were centrally cut and stained for Ki67. The outcome cohort was from 149 breast cancer cases from the Yale Pathology archives. A tissue microarray was built from representative tissue blocks with median follow-up of 120 months. The Mib-1 antibody (Dako) was used to detect Ki67 (dilution 1:100). HALO (IndicaLab), QuantCenter (3DHistech), and QuPath (open source software) digital image analysis (DIA) platforms were used to evaluate Ki67 expression. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure reproducibility. Between-DIA platform reproducibility was excellent (ICC: 0.933, CI: 0.879–0.966). Excellent reproducibility was found between all DIA platforms and the reference standard Ki67 values of Spectrum Webscope (QuPath-Spectrum Webscope ICC: 0.970, CI: 0.936–0.986; HALO-Spectrum Webscope ICC: 0.968, CI: 0.933–0.985; QuantCenter-Spectrum Webscope ICC: 0.964, CI: 0.919–0.983). All platforms showed excellent intra-DIA reproducibility (QuPath ICC: 0.992, CI: 0.986–0.996; HALO ICC: 0.972, CI: 0.924–0.988; QuantCenter ICC: 0.978, CI: 0.932–0.991). Comparing each DIA against outcome, the hazard ratios were similar. The inter-operator reproducibility was particularly high (ICC: 0.962–0.995). Our results showed outstanding reproducibility both within and between-DIA platforms, including one freely available DIA platform (QuPath).

There is considerable heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations. This study aimed to determine associations between CDH1 germline variant status and clinical phenotypes of HDGC. Methods: One hundred and fifty-two HDGC families, including six previously unreported families, were identified. CDH1 gene-specific guidelines released by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) CDH1 Variant Curation Expert Panel were applied for pathogenicity classification of truncating, missense and splice site CDH1 germline variants. We evaluated ORs between location of truncating variants of CDH1 and incidence of colorectal cancer, breast cancer and cancer at young age (gastric cancer at <40 or breast cancer <50 years of age). Results: Frequency of truncating germline CDH1 variants varied across functional domains of the E-cadherin receptor gene and was highest in linker (0.05785 counts/base pair; p=0.0111) and PRE regions (0.10000; p=0.0059). Families with truncating CDH1 germline variants located in the PRE-PRO region were six times more likely to have family members affected by colorectal cancer (OR 6.20, 95% CI 1.79 to 21.48; p=0.004) compared with germline variants in other regions. Variants in the intracellular E-cadherin region were protective for cancer at young age (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64; p=0.0071) and in the linker regions for breast cancer (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.99; p=0.0493). Different CDH1 genotypes were associated with different intracellular signalling activation levels including different p-ERK, p-mTOR and β-catenin levels in early submucosal T1a lesions of HDGC families with different CDH1 variants. Conclusion: Type and location of CDH1 germline variants may help to identify families at increased risk for concomitant cancers that might benefit from individualised surveillance and intervention strategies. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Unfortunately, despite its proven survival benefits, postmastectomy radiation therapy is deleterious to the skin and soft tissue, causing increased complications and worse aesthetic outcomes after breast reconstruction. There is currently no effective pharmaceutical agent to mitigate the soft tissue fibrosis and hypovascularity associated with soft tissue radiation. We hypothesized that a novel topical formulation of deferoxamine (DFX) will result in improved cutaneous vascularity and soft tissue pliability in an animal model of irradiated tissue expander-based breast reconstruction. Methods This study consisted of 16 hairless rats divided into 4 equal groups: a control group (expander only), a tissue expanded and irradiated group, a tissue expanded + DFX group, and a tissue expanded/irradiated/DFX group. A novel topical formulation of DFX consisted of reconstituted drug dissolved in agents designed to enhance dermal penetrance. Vessels per high-power field (vHPF) were quantified histologically; micro-computed tomography angiography was used to assess vessel volume fraction (VVF) and vessel length density. Results Irradiated skin had less vascularity compared with control (3.81 vHPF vs 8.25 vHPF, P = 0.03; 0.79% VVF vs 1.53% VVF, P = 0.06). Treatment of irradiated skin with topical DFX reversed these effects, resulting in vascular findings similar to the control group histologically (7.94 vHPF vs 8.25 HPF, P = 0.985) and via micro-computed tomography angiography (1.05% VVF vs 1.53% VVF, P = 0.272). Similarly, radiation resulted in less volume expansion compared with controls (0.72 vs 0.8 mL, P = 0.04), whereas treatment with topical DFX reversed this effect, allowing for an expansion volume similar to the control group (0.81 vs 0.80 mL, P = 0.999). Conclusions In an animal model of irradiated tissue expander-based breast reconstruction, treatment with topical DFX improved the cutaneous vascularity and tissue pliability, resulting in vascular density and final tissue expansion volumes similar to those found in the nonirradiated control group. Topical DFX may be an effective agent for the treatment of soft tissue radiation injury; future studies are indicated to further characterize this novel drug formulation. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess for early RT-induced changes in echocardiographic and circulating biomarkers of left ventricular (LV) function and evaluate their association with radiation dose to the heart among patients with HER2-positive BCA treated with contemporary RT. Methods: A total of 47 women with HER2-positive BCA who were treated with an anthracycline, trastuzumab, and RT to the breast and/or chest wall ± regional lymph nodes were included in this study. Two-dimensional echocardiography with speckle-tracking imaging was performed at baseline (prechemotherapy), prior to and after RT (pre-RT and post-RT), and 6 months post-RT. High-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) was measured pre-RT and post-RT. Associations between mean heart dose (MHD) and changes in LV function after RT were examined in multivariable linear regression models. Results: The MHD was 1.8 ± 1.5 Gy for patients receiving left-sided RT (n = 26) and 1.1 ± 1.3 Gy for patients receiving right-sided RT (n = 21). Pre-RT, post-RT, and 6-month post-RT echocardiograms were performed at median (interquartile range) of 49 days (27, 77) before and 54 days (25, 78) and 195 days (175, 226) after RT, respectively. Compared with pre-RT, a minimal decrease in LV ejection fraction was observed post-RT (61% ± 7% vs 59% ± 8%; P = .003) without any significant change in global longitudinal, circumferential, or radial strain or diastolic indices at the post-RT timepoint. Median (interquartile range) concentrations of hsTnI decreased from 5.7 pg/mL (3.0, 8.7) pre-RT to 3.7 pg/mL (2.0, 5.9) post-RT. There was no significant change in systolic or diastolic indices of LV function at 6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT. MHD was not associated with changes in echocardiographic parameters of LV function after RT. Conclusions: Breast RT using contemporary techniques can be delivered without evidence of early subclinical LV dysfunction or injury as measured by echocardiography and hsTnI in patients treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Future studies should focus on identifying alternative biomarkers to elucidate early RT-induced cardiovascular effects and further characterizing long-term cardiovascular outcomes associated with contemporary breast RT. © 2018 American Society of Echocardiography","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062015614

Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, variable flip angles and magnetization preparation modules were applied to acquire MR fingerprinting data for each partition of a three-dimensional data set. A fast postprocessing method was implemented by using singular value decomposition. The proposed technique was first validated in phantoms and then applied to 15 healthy female participants (mean age, 24.2 years ± 5.1 [standard deviation]; range, 18-35 years) and 14 female participants with breast cancer (mean age, 55.4 years ± 8.8; range, 39-66 years) between March 2016 and April 2018. The sensitivity of the method to B1 field inhomogeneity was also evaluated by using the Bloch-Siegert method. Results: Phantom results showed that accurate and volumetric T1 and T2 quantification was achieved by using the proposed technique. The acquisition time for three-dimensional quantitative maps with a spatial resolution of 1.6 × 1.6 × 3 mm 3 was approximately ± minutes. For healthy participants, averaged T1 and T2 relaxation times for fibroglandular tissues at 3.0 T were 1256 msec ± 171 and 46 msec ± 7, respectively.

Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA from affected and unaffected individuals revealed a novel missense mutation in the exonuclease domain of POLE (c.833C&gt;A; p.Thr278Lys) associated with a highly penetrant, autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. Functional studies in yeast and demonstration of a high mutational burden in the available tumors confirmed the pathogenicity of the novel variant. Prominent POLE-deficient somatic mutational signatures were seen in the CRCs, but in contrast, a mutational signature typical of concomitant tumoral loss of POLE and mismatch-repair function (POLE-exo * /MSI) was noted in the breast cancer. The breast cancer also showed distinctive pathological characteristics that reflect the presence of both the germline POLE variant and the secondary somatic MMR alterations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85056789136

Using the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study aimed to identify the strongest predictors from the TPB of AET intentions and past behavior and assessed whether ambivalence and anticipatory emotions increased the predictive capacity of TPB. Methods: Two hundred eighty women diagnosed with hormone positive (HR+) breast cancer who filled at least one prescription of AET responded to a survey measuring TPB constructs, attitudinal ambivalence, and anticipatory emotions. The outcomes were intentions to adhere to AET and past medication adherence (previous 2 weeks). Results: The TPB explained 66% of intentions to adhere to AET (P &lt; 0.001). Ambivalence did not improve the TPB model's predictive value. When emotions were included with TPB, the model explained 70% of adherence intentions F 11,226  = 52.84, P &lt; 0.001 (R 2 c  =.70).

We examined the joint associations of pre- and post- diagnosis RPA with mortality in a cohort of 5,807 patients enrolled in the Data Bank and BioRepository at Roswell Park. Methods: Patients were classified into one of four activity categories (habitually active, increased activity after diagnosis, decreased activity after diagnosis, habitually inactive). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations of activity status with mortality. Results: In comparison to patients who were habitually inactive, habitually active patients experienced a 39% decreased hazard of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.54–0.69) and a 36% decreased hazard of cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.56–0.73). Previously inactive patients who began exercising after diagnosis experienced a 28% decreased hazard of all-cause (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.89) and cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.57–0.91) in comparison to patients who remained inactive. Patients engaging in 3–4 sessions/week experienced the greatest survival advantages, but 1–2 sessions/week also yielded significant survival advantages in comparison to inactivity. Conclusion: Low-to-moderate frequency pre- and post-diagnosis RPA was associated with significantly decreased mortality in patients diagnosed with a variety of malignancies. These observations solidify the clinical and public health importance of the message that some regular activity is better than inactivity, which is particularly encouraging, given that cancer survivors can be overwhelmed by current daily physical activity recommendations. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Final",,2-s2.0-85057831516

Clinical-pathologic studies with respect to varied morphologic subtypes are lacking. There is also a dearth of studies assessing the response of metaplastic breast carcinoma to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cases of metaplastic breast carcinoma diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 were identified. Various clinical-pathologic variables were tested for association with survival. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assessed for pathologic response. Median age at diagnosis with metaplastic breast carcinoma was 64 years. With a median follow-up of 39 months, 26 patients (27%) recurred (24 distant and 2 loco-regional). The overall survival rate of the cohort was 66% (64/97). A number of variables were associated with survival in univariable analysis; however, in multivariable analysis, only lymph node status and tumor size (pT3 vs. pT1/2) were significantly associated with all survival endpoints: recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. Twenty-nine of 97 (30%) patients with metaplastic breast carcinoma received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five (17%) patients achieved pathologic complete response. Matrix-producing morphology was associated with higher probability of achieving pathologic complete response (p = 0.027). Similar to other breast cancer subtypes, tumor size and lymph node status are prognostic in metaplastic carcinomas. The pathologic complete response rate of metaplastic breast carcinoma in our cohort was 17%, higher than previously reported.

Two groups of experts completed each Delphi process: the core group of breast imaging educators and an expert panel of national experts in breast imaging standards and appropriateness. Results: Five EPA-BRs were developed, with eight nested EPA-BRs, one of which is elective. This comprehensive list of EPA-BRs covers the role of a breast imaging radiologist in the care of a patient from detection of breast cancer to post-treatment follow-up.

Methods: We analyzed the Truven MarketScan Databases from 2009 to 2015 to identify adult female patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty for macromastia. We recorded patient age, rates of obtaining pathology evaluation, new diagnoses of benign or malignant breast disease after pathology evaluation, and total cost for the surgery encounter. Results: Among 17,738 macromastia patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty, 91.3% (n = 16,193) received pathology evaluation. Pathology evaluation rates were clinically similar across age groups <70 years (90.8–92.1%) and slightly lower for patients ≥70 (85.0%). Among 6987 patients less than 40 years who received pathology evaluation, 0.06% (n = 4) were subsequently diagnosed with malignant breast disease within 3 months, compared to 0.23% in the entire cohort (n = 37/16,193). Pathology claims resulted in an added $307 (SD 251) on average for the breast reduction surgery encounters. Conclusions: Breast tissue after reduction mammaplasty is routinely submitted for pathology evaluation, without consideration of age-based risk for breast cancer. Routine pathology evaluation of breast tissue in patients in lower risk age groups (less than 40 years) required an additional $536,000 on average to detect a single occult breast cancer compared to an added $85,600 to detect a new malignancy in patients 40 years and older. Clinicians and policy makers should consider whether routine pathology evaluation of breast tissue should be individualized based on risk factors for breast cancer. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061090859

This pilot randomized controlled trial tested the feasibility and initial efficacy of CARE, drawing from age-appropriate developmental themes and well-established coping theory. Method: Eligible patients were ≥70 years old; ≥6 months post-diagnosis of lung, prostate, breast, lymphoma, or gynecological cancer; on active cancer treatment or within 6 months of ending cancer treatment; and had elevated scores on the Distress Thermometer (≥4) or Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (≥6). Participants completed five sessions of psychotherapy over 7 weeks with assessments at study entry, post-intervention, and 2 months post-intervention. Primary outcomes were feasibility and initial efficacy on anxiety and depression; secondary outcomes included demoralization, coping, loneliness, and spiritual well-being. Results: Fifty-nine participants were randomized to either the CARE arm (n = 31) or the enhanced Social Work Control arm (n = 28). The intervention was feasible and tolerable, meeting a priori criteria for rates of eligibility, acceptance, retention, assessment, and treatment fidelity.

A wise pattern (inverted-T) mastectomy incision (WPM) has been suggested as an alternative to the standard horizontal elliptical mastectomy (EM) to reduce redundant skin and correct ptosis. Herein, we sought to examine the differences in morbidity between the two techniques. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of women undergoing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction at our institution from June 2007 to January 2016. We compared those undergoing WPM to a control population undergoing EM. Statistical analysis was performed evaluating clinical, pathological, and surgical outcome variables according to patient and per breast. All tests were two-sided with alpha level set at 0.05 for statistical significance. Results: A total of 241 women underwent mastectomy and reconstruction in 421 breasts; 78/241 (32%) had WPM (149 breasts), 163/241 (68%) had EM (272 breasts). Both groups were similar in age, smoking status, diabetes, race, tumor type, and pathologic stage (all P > 0.07).

Despite the rising trend in breast cancer incidence and mortality across Sub-Saharan Africa, there remains a critical knowledge gap about the burden and patterns of breast disease and breast cancer screening practices at the population level. This study aimed to identify socioeconomic factors associated with knowledge and practice of breast self-examination (BSE) as well as assess the prevalence of breast disease symptoms among a mixed urban-rural population of women in the Southwest region of Cameroon. Methods. We conducted a household-level community-based study in Southwest Cameroon between January and March 2017, using a three-stage cluster sampling framework. We surveyed 1287 households and collected self-reported data on 4208 female subjects, 790 of whom were household representatives. Each household representative provided information on behalf of all female household members about any ongoing breast disease symptoms. Moreover, female household representatives were questioned about their own knowledge and practice of BSE. Results. Women demonstrated low frequency of knowledge of BSE, as 25% (n=201) of household representatives reported any knowledge of BSE; and among these only 15% (n=30) practiced BSE on a monthly basis. Age (aOR: 1.04), usage of Liquid Petroleum Gas fuel, a marker of higher socioeconomic status (aOR: 1.86), and speaking English as a primary language in the household (aOR: 1.59) were significant predictors of knowledge of BSE. Eleven women reported ongoing breast disease symptoms resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.3 cases of breast disease symptoms per 1000 women. Conclusions.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been implemented to improve patient care. The aim of this project was to identify variation in the perioperative care of women undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction to inform development of an ERAS protocol. Methods: Surveys were developed for plastic surgeons, anaesthetists and the lead clinician for breast reconstruction at each unit. These assessed most aspects of perioperative care. A team of medical student collaborators was identified. This team created a list of surgeons and anaesthetists in the United Kingdom by unit. REDCap was used to record their responses. Results: Nineteen (19/39, 49%) lead clinicians, 83 (83/134, 62%) plastic surgeons and 71 (71/100, 71%) anaesthetists from units across the UK completed the surveys. Marked variation was identified in the clinician responses when compared with the national and international guidelines. This variation covered many aspects of patient care including antibiotic and fluid prescribing, surgical technique, post-operative care and recording of patient outcomes. Conclusions: The optiFLAPP national practice survey has demonstrated variation in the perioperative care of women undergoing abdominal-based microvascular breast reconstruction. We propose a large prospective audit to assess current protocols and support development of randomised controlled trials. © 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85054138005

However, the mechanistic basis of these protective effects of exercise is not well known. Changes in tumor cytokines, such as oncostatin-M (OSM), have been associated with modulation of antitumor immune responses in breast cancer. Exercise and antioxidants such as selenium affect both antitumor immune responses as well as tumor cytokine expression. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of aerobic exercise training (AET) and selenium nanoparticle (SeNP) administration on T-helper 1 and 2 and tumor tissue cytokines in mice bearing the 4 T1 mammary carcinoma. Methods: We examined the effects of 6 wk of AET and SeNP administration (100 μg three times/wk) on tumor size, concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-γ IL-4 and OSM in tumor tissue and INF-γ and IL-4 in splenocytes of 64 mice bearing the 4 T1 mammary carcinoma. Results: AET increased OSM levels in tumor tissue. Moreover, AET increased levels of TNF-α in tumor tissue, whereas SeNP supplementation decreased IL-4 levels tumor tissue. Also, the combination of AET and SeNP administration decreased tumor volume and increased T-helper 1 cytokines in the splenocytes of tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the combination of AET and SeNP supplementation effects antitumor immune responses in splenocytes, whereas AET induced antitumor cytokines, such as OSM and TNF-α in tumor tissue. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85052317482

Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has become a trending issue in phantom constructions for medical applications, with its advantages of being customizable and cost-efficient. However, there is no current practice in the field of multi-purpose breast phantom for quality control (QC) in multi-modalities imaging. The purpose of this study was to fabricate a multi-purpose breast phantom with tissue-equivalent materials via a 3D printing technique for QC in multi-modalities imaging. Methods: We used polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based materials and a 3D printing technique to construct a breast phantom. The phantom incorporates structures imaged in the female breast such as microcalcifications, fiber lesions, and tumors with different sizes. Moreover, the phantom was used to assess the sensitivity of lesion detection, depth resolution, and detectability thresholds with different imaging modalities. Phantom tissue equivalent properties were determined using computed tomography (CT) attenuation [Hounsfield unit (HU)] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxation times. Results: The 3D-printed breast phantom had an average background value of 36.2 HU, which is close to that of glandular breast tissue (40 HU). T1 and T2 relaxation times had an average relaxation time of 206.81±17.50 and 20.22±5.74 ms, respectively. Mammographic imaging had improved detection of microcalcification compared with ultrasound and MRI with multiple sequences [T1WI, T2WI and short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR)]. Soft-tissue lesion detection and cylindrical tumor contrast were superior with mammography and MRI compared to ultrasound. Hemispherical tumor detection was similar regardless of the imaging modality used. Conclusions: We developed a multi-purpose breast phantom using a 3D printing technique and determined its value for multi-modal breast imaging studies. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Only several hundred oncogenes have been identified, primarily via mutation-based approaches, in the human genome. Transcriptional overexpression is a less-explored mechanism through which oncogenes can arise. Methods: Here, a new statistical approach, termed oncomix, which captures transcriptional heterogeneity in tumour and adjacent normal (i.e., tumour-free) mRNA expression profiles, was developed to identify oncogene candidates that were overexpressed in a subset of breast tumours. Results: Intronic DNA methylation was strongly associated with the overexpression of chromobox 2 (CBX2), an oncogene candidate that was identified using our method but not through prior analytical approaches. CBX2 overexpression in breast tumours was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and with poorer 5-year survival. The predicted function of CBX2 was confirmed in vitro, providing the first experimental evidence that CBX2 promotes breast cancer cell growth. Conclusions: Oncomix is a novel approach that captures transcriptional heterogeneity between tumour and adjacent normal tissue, and that has the potential to uncover therapeutic targets that benefit subsets of cancer patients. CBX2 is an oncogene candidate that should be further explored as a potential drug target for aggressive types of breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article in Press",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062354032

However, the normal appearance of the nipple at MRI is not well defined because of a paucity of scientific literature on this topic. Hence, there is a lack of descriptive terminology and diagnostic criteria, which may account for the wide variability in interpretation among radiologists when assessing the NAC on MR images. In light of the current shift toward possible expanded use of abbreviated (ie, fast) breast MRI for screening in women at average risk for cancer in particular, and because an increasing number of women now undergo nipple-sparing mastectomy for therapeutic and/or prophylactic indications, careful assessment of the NAC at MRI is essential. In this article, the normal pattern of nipple enhancement at MRI is defined on the basis of findings observed in healthy individuals, normal nipple enhancement at MRI is correlated with the structural anatomy of the nipple at histopathologic analysis, and artifacts and pitfalls related to MRI of the NAC are reviewed. Understanding the normal range of nipple morphology and enhancement at MRI is important, as it enables radiologists to better differentiate between normal and abnormal nipple findings with increased diagnostic confidence. © RSNA, 2018.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059795756

These fusions are consistently detected in rare cancer types (e.g., secretory breast carcinoma and congenital infantile fibrosarcoma), but the occurrence of NTRK fusions in common cancers and their relationship to other therapy biomarkers are largely unexplored. Tissue samples from 11,502 patients were analyzed for 53 gene fusions and sequencing of 592 genes, along with an immunohistochemical evaluation of TrkA/B/C and PD-L1. Thirty-one cases (0.27% of the entire cohort) had NTRK fusions. The most common fusions were ETV6:NTRK3 (n = 10) and TPM3:NTRK1 (n = 6). Gliomas had the highest number of NTRK fusions (14/982, 1.4%), most commonly involving NTRK2 (n = 9). Seventeen non-glioma cases with NTRK fusions included carcinomas of the lungs, thyroid, breast, cervix, colon, nasal cavity, cancer of unknown primary and soft tissue sarcomas. Strong and uniform Trk expression detected with a pan-Trk immunohistochemistry characterized 7/8 NTRK1 fusion cases and 8/9 NTRK2 fusion cases, while NTRK3 fused cases were positive in 6/11 (55%) of cases. 29% of NTRK fusion cases had no other pathogenic genomic alteration. PD-L1 expression was observed in 23% of NTRK fused cases while high tumor DNA microsatellite instability was detected in two cases. We confirm the rarity of NTRK genes fusions outside the brain malignancies. NTRK inhibitors alone or combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors may be a therapeutic option for a substantial proportion of these patients.

As some states elected to expand Medicaid and others did not, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of Medicaid expansion on the insurance status at cancer diagnosis of brachytherapy patients. Methods and Materials: Patients aged 19–64 years with breast, cervical, uterine, or prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy from 2011 to 2014 with known insurance status were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Fisher's exact test was used to test for associations of insurance status with expanded versus nonexpanded states. For multivariate analysis, a binomial logistic regression was performed, dichotomized to uninsured versus any insurance. Results: Fifteen thousand four hundred ninety-seven subjects met entry criteria. In the entire cohort, rates of uninsurance were higher in nonexpanded states at baseline (4.5% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.00001). With selective Medicaid expansion in 2014, expanded states had a reduction in uninsurance rates (2.9–1.8%, p = 0.026), whereas nonexpanded states had a nonsignificant increase in uninsurance (4.5–5.0%, p = 0.371). There was a reduction in uninsurance in expanded states in areas of highest poverty (2.9–1.1%, p = 0.0004) not seen in nonexpanded states. These associations remained significant on multivariate analysis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8–2.8, p < 0.00001). Conclusions: Patients who received brachytherapy were less likely to be uninsured in states where Medicaid was expanded, particularly evident in regions with highest poverty levels.

Methods: Questionnaires include data on demographic characteristics, illness perception, symptom self-care activity, and QOL. A secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of ethnic Chinese breast-and-colon cancer patients (n = 159) to examine multivariate associations. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlational analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis were used to analyze quantitative data. Results: The hierarchical regression model explained 43% of variance in QOL. Perceived illness consequence, personal control, and performance functioning status were found to be significant predictors in the model. Comparisons between breast-and-colon cancer patients showed that colon cancer patients significantly perceived higher levels of chronicity and negativity toward cancer than breast cancer patients. Conversely, breast cancer patients had significantly higher level of QOL and efficacy in making decision. Stress and overwork were the common perceived causes of cancer reported by these patients. Conclusions: These findings suggest that improving self-care efficacy and positive personal control can improve Chinese cancer patients' QOL.

Methods: The authors prospectively enrolled patients with advanced cancer and collected data regarding patient demographics, cancer diagnosis, morphine equivalent daily dose, cigarette smoking status using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, symptom expression as measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the Cut down/Annoyed/Guilty/Eye opener alcoholism questionnaire, the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain–short form survey, and the Brief COPE Questionnaire. Results: Among 399 patients, 195 (49%) were never-smokers, 158 (40%) were former smokers, and 46 (11%) were current smokers. The most common malignancies were gastrointestinal (21%) and breast (19%). Current smokers demonstrated significantly higher pain scores at the time of consultation compared with former or never-smokers (mean 6.4 vs 5.9 vs 5.1, respectively; P =.015), demonstrated increased morphine equivalent daily dose (median 90 mg/day vs 60 mg/day vs 50 mg/day, respectively; P =.002), were more likely to screen as positive on the Cut down/Annoyed/Guilty/Eye opener questionnaire (33% vs 24% vs 8.7%, respectively; P <.0001) and were more likely to screen as positive (≥4) on the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain–short form survey (74% vs 13% vs 9.3%, respectively; P <.0001). Compared with former and never-smokers, current smokers were significantly more likely to cope maladaptively with substance use (P =.02), denial (P =.007), and self-blame (P <.0001). Conclusions: Among patients with advanced cancer, current and former smokers appear to be significantly more likely to have higher pain expression and thus require higher opioid doses, and to have more risk factors for using opioids in a nonprescribed manner.

Methods: Consecutive adult patients who underwent surgical resection of a BM at a tertiary care institution between 2001 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Only patients with the most common primary cancers (lung, breast, skin-melanoma, colon, and kidney) were included. Preoperative MRIs were reviewed to classify all tumors by cerebral vascular territory (anterior cerebral artery-ACA, lenticulostriate, middle cerebral artery-MCA, posterior cerebral artery-PCA, posterior fossa, and watershed), and T2-weighted FLAIR widths were measured. Chi square analyses were performed to determine differences in cerebral vascular distribution by primary tumor type, and one-way ANOVA analyses were performed to determine FLAIR signal differences. Results: 669 tumors from 388 patients were classified from lung (n = 316 BMs), breast (n = 144), melanoma (n = 119), renal (n = 47), and colon (n = 43). BMs from breast cancer were less likely to be located in PCA territory (n = 18 [13%]; χ 2 = 6.10, p = 0.01). BMs from melanoma were less likely to be located in cerebellar territory (n = 11 [9%]; χ 2 = 14.1, p &lt; 0.001), and more likely to be located in lateral (n = 5 [4%]; χ 2 = 4.56, p = 0.03) and medial lenticulostriate territories (n = 2 [2%]; χ 2 = 6.93, p = 0.009). BMs from breast and melanoma had shorter T2-FLAIR widths, with an average [IQR] of 47.2 [19.6–69.2] mm (p = 0.01) and 41.2 [14.4–62.7] mm (p = 0.002) respectively. Conversely, BMs from renal cancer had longer T2-FLAIR widths (64.2 [43.6–80.8] mm, p = 0.002).

The objective of this study was to analyze PFS, dose reductions, dose delays, and toxicity in a geriatric population receiving palbociclib in a non-trial setting. Methods: Patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving palbociclib in any line of therapy were identified from a cohort of 845 patients at a large academic institution. Dose delays, dose reductions, and toxicities were retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Data were analyzed using Fischer’s exact test for categorized variables and T test/Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: 605 patients who met eligibility criteria were included. 160 patients were ≥ 65 years old and 92 patients were ≥ 70 years old. Patients ≥ 70 had a significantly increased number of dose reductions (p = 0.03) and dose delays (p = 0.02) compared to the younger patients. There was no significant increase in toxicities, including neutropenic fever, infections, or hospitalizations, in the ≥ 70 cohort (p = 0.3). The ≥ 70 cohort had a significantly improved PFS as compared to the younger cohort (p = 0.02); however, age was no longer a significant variable in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Palbociclib was well tolerated in the geriatric population and there was no difference in PFS between older and younger patients.

Previous research has shown that screening mammography contributes to reduced breast cancer mortality. This study aimed to clarify why late screening might occur in an at-risk population. Materials and Methods: This study was a prospective cross-sectional study including 758 patients presenting to our radiology department for routine screening mammography who completed a 30-question survey regarding personal characteristics and mammography history. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to determine whether survey responses correlated with late screening. Results: Of the 758 patients, 184 (24%) were noncompliant with screening mammography guidelines. Risk factors for late screening included younger age (P = 0.001), white race/ethnicity (P = 0.03), self-reported lack of financial means or health insurance (P = 0.005), lack of satisfaction with a previous mammogram experience (P = 0.001), inadequate mammography education by a physician (P = 0.001), and lack of awareness/comprehension of screening mammography guidelines (P = 0.002). Conclusion: Many factors contribute to late screening mammography.

Methods: An IRB-approved prospective study was conducted. The rapid screening pancreatic MR protocol was designed to be less than 10 min to be performed after a standard breast MRI protocol. Protocol consisted of coronal NT T2 SSFSE, axial NT T2 SSFSE and axial NT rFOV FOCUS DWI, and axial T1. Images were acquired with the patient in the same prone position of breast MRI using the built-in body coil. Image quality was qualitatively assessed by two radiologists with 12 and 13 years of MRI experience, respectively. The imaging protocol was modified until an endpoint of five consecutive patients with high-quality diagnostic images were achieved. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio were assessed. Results: The rapid pancreas MR protocol was successfully completed in all patients. Diagnostic image quality was achieved for all patients. Excellent image quality was achieved for low b values; however, image quality at higher b values was more variable. In one patient, a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor was found and the patient was treated surgically. In four patients, small pancreatic cystic lesions were detected. In one subject, a hepatic mass was identified and confirmed as adenoma by liver MRI. Conclusion: Rapid MR protocol for pancreatic cancer screening is feasible and has the potential to play a role in screening BRCA patients undergoing breast MRI.

The detection of Cerenkov luminescence during radionuclide therapy was simulated using the Monte Carlo technique for breast cancer treatment as an example. Our results show that with the pinhole collimator-based configuration, the location, size and shape of the tumors can be clearly visualized on the Cerenkov luminescence images of the breast phantom. In addition, the CLI of multiple tumors can reflect the relative density of radioactivity among tumors, indicating that the intensity of Cerenkov luminescence is independent of the size and shape of a tumor.

In this study, we investigated [ 18 F]FDG accumulation and efflux in relation to the genes and proteins involved in glucose metabolism in murine inflammation and cancer models. Procedures: [ 18 F]FDG accumulation and [ 18 F]FDG efflux were measured in cancer cells (breast cancer, glioma, thyroid cancer, and hepatoma cells) and RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The levels of mRNA expression were measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The expression of glucose metabolism–related proteins was detected by western blotting. Dynamic [ 18 F]FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) images were acquired for 2 h in tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice and inflammatory mice induced by turpentine oil. Results: [ 18 F]FDG accumulation in MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) increased with time, but that of HepG2 (hepatoma) reached a constant level after 120 min. [ 18 F]FDG efflux in HepG2 was faster than that in MDA-MB-231. HepG2 strongly expressed glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) compared with MDA-MB-231. [ 18 F]FDG accumulation increased with time, and [ 18 F]FDG efflux accelerated after the activation of RAW 264.7 cells. The expression levels of G6Pase, glucose transporter1 and glucose transporter3 (GLUT1 and GLUT3), and hexokinase II (HK II) increased after the activation of RAW 264.7 cells. [ 18 F]FDG efflux in activated macrophages was faster than that in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 strongly expressed HK II protein compared with the activated RAW 264.7.

The goal of this study was to assess associations between UGT2B17 gene deletion and bone health prior to and after 24 months of AI treatment in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer. Methods: Bone health in women with HR+ breast cancer enrolled on the prospective randomized Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenetics (ELPh) trial was determined by measuring bone turnover markers (BTM) and bone mineral density (BMD) pre-treatment and after 3 BTM and 24 BMD months of treatment with either the steroidal AI exemestane or the nonsteroidal AI letrozole. DNA samples were genotyped for UGT2B17*2. Results: Of the 455 subjects included in the analyses, 244 (53.6%) carried at least one copy of UGT2B17*2. UGT2B17*2 was associated with lower pre-treatment BMD at the hip (P = 0.01) and spine (P = 0.0076). Letrozole treatment was associated with a greater decrease in BMD of the hip (P = 0.03) and spine (P = 0.03) than exemestane. UGT2B17 genotype was not associated with changes in BMD from 24 months of AI treatment, though in UGT2B17*2 homozygous patients, there was a trend toward greater decreases in BMD of the spine from treatment with letrozole compared with exemestane (P = 0.05). Conclusion: UGT2B17*2 may be associated with lower baseline BMD in women with HR+ breast cancer. Exemestane is less detrimental to bone health than letrozole in postmenopausal women treated with AI, and this effect may be confined to patients carrying UGT2B17*2, though this finding requires independent validation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061589543

Methods: The NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), Cancer Trends Progress Report, and Funding Statistics were used to analyze 18 cancer sites. Site-specific mortality to incidence ratios (MIR) were normalized per 100 cases and multiplied by person-years of life lost to derive cancer-specific lethality. NCI funding was divided by its lethality to calculate Funding to Lethality scores for gynecologic malignancies and compared to 15 other cancer sites. Results: Ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancers ranked 10th (score 0.097, SD 0.008), 12th (0.087, SD 0.009), and 14th (0.057, SD 0.006) for average Funding to Lethality scores. The highest average score was for prostate cancer (score 1.182, SD 0.364). In U.S. dollars per 100 incident cases, prostate cancer received an average of $1,821,000 per person-years of life lost, while ovarian cancer received $97,000, cervical cancer $87,000, and uterine cancer $57,000.

Our previous study indicated that MEOX1 is a critical molecular target in mesenchymal-like cancer cells in PTEN-deficient Trastuzumab resistant breast cancer. Despite the potential implication of MEOX1 for the cancer progression, no previous studies examined its level and clinical significance in lung cancer tissues. In this study, we aimed to detect the MEOX1 expression and correlate its level with clinical outcome in non-small-cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC). Methods: MEOX1 gene expression in lung cancer was examined by using the Oncomine database. MEOX1 protein levels were evaluated by IHC using the corresponding primary antibody on two different commercial lung cancer tissue arrays. siRNA knockdown was used to elucidate the function of MEOX1. Results: Analysis of the Oncomine datasets identified that an elevation of MEOX1 in gene amplification in lung cancer tissues in comparison to normal lung tissues. Immunohistochemistical analysis demonstrated that MEOX1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus, and positive rate was 67.3% (111/165) in NSCLC samples. Statistical analysis revealed high levels of MEOX1 significantly correlated with Lymph Node Metastasis and Stage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high levels of MEOX1 were significantly associated with unfavorable survival in NSCLC patients, and MEOX1 nucleus staining had worse survival, than did patients with overall expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis found that MEOX1 was an independent poor prognostic predictor for patients with NSCLC. Silencing of MEOX1 by specific SiRNA significantly inhibited H460 and H1299 cell proliferation and sphere formation in serum-free medium. Conclusions: Our results firstly indentified that high levels of MEOX1 especially nuclear staining was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC, and it served a essential roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. It may represent a potential target for the NSCLC treatment. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060131702

Poor adherence to AET is a significant problem and contributes to increased medical costs and mortality. A variety of problematic symptoms associated with AET are related to non-adherence and early discontinuation of treatment. The goal of this study is to test a novel, telephone-based coping skills training that teaches patients adherence skills and techniques for coping with problematic symptoms (CST-AET). Adherence to AET will be assessed in real-time for 18 months using wireless smart pill bottles. Symptom interference (i.e., pain, vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, vaginal dryness) and cost-effectiveness of the intervention protocol will be examined as secondary outcomes. Participants (N = 400) will be recruited from a tertiary care medical center or community clinics in medically underserved or rural areas. Participants will be randomized to receive CST-AET or a general health education intervention (comparison condition). CST-AET includes ten nurse-delivered calls delivered over 6 months. CST-AET provides systematic training in coping skills for managing symptoms that interfere with adherence. Interactive voice messaging provides reinforcement for skills use and adherence that is tailored based on real-time adherence data from the wireless smart pill bottles. Given the high rates of non-adherence and recent recommendations that women remain on AET for 10 years, we describe a timely trial. If effective, the CST-AET protocol may not only reduce the burden of AET use but also lead to cost-effective changes in clinical care and improve breast cancer outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between pain severity and subjective (ie, severity of numbness) and objective (ie, loss of light touch sensations, vibration thresholds) measures of loss of large fiber function in adult survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN, n=426) and breast cancer patients with persistent postsurgical pain (n=80). Material and Methods: For both samples, average pain and numbness were evaluated using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale. Loss of light touch sensations in the hands and feet of patients with CIPN and in the upper arm of patients at 5 and 6 months following breast cancer surgery were assessed using Semmes Weinstein monofilaments. Loss of vibration in the hands and feet of patients with CIPN was assessed using a biothesiometer. Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients were calculated between average pain and the number or percentage of sites with loss of light touch sensations, mean vibration thresholds, and the severity of numbness. Results: For both pain conditions, average pain scores were significantly correlated with objective measures of large fiber function (r=0.12 to 0.34; all P<0.05) and numbness (r=0.22 to 0.52; all P<0.008). Discussion: Our findings, in 2 independent samples of oncology patients, suggest that loss of function of myelinated, large diameter fibers contributes to the severity of neuropathic pain.

We explore this by examining how adherence to endocrine therapy (ET) for women with breast cancer was impacted by reducing copayments for medications by the introduction of generic ETs among women who do not receive a subsidy (the ""treatment"" group) to those that do receive a subsidy and are not exposed to any changes in copayments (the ""control"" group). Methods: We examined monthly adherence to ET using the proportion of days covered for women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2009 using SEER-Medicare data. To account for baseline trends, we characterize adherence for 1 year before generic approval of ET using GBTMs, within each groups we generate inverse probability treatment weights of not receiving a subsidy. We compared adherence after generic entry within each GBTM using a modified Poisson model. Results: GBTMs for adherence in the 1-year pregeneric identified 6 groups. When comparing patients who did and did not receive a subsidy we found no overall effect of generic introduction. However, 1 of the 6 identified adherence groups postgeneric adherence increased [the ""consistently low"" (risk ratio=1.91; 95% confidence interval=1.34-2.72)].

Management of LBA and the resulting outcomes on a nationwide scale has not been previously examined. Methods: The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) from 2004 to 2014 identified resected LBA patients. Treatment patterns were compared between three time periods (2004–2007, 2008–2011, and 2012–2014). Demographic and tumor characteristics, as well as treatments received—extent of surgery and adjuvant therapies—were analyzed for association with overall survival after adjustment for covariates. Results: 826 resected localized breast angiosarcoma patients were identified. Mastectomy was the most common surgical approach (86%); over 60% of patients did not receive adjuvant therapies after surgery. On multivariate analysis, tumor grade, tumor size, and surgical margins were associated with worse survival. Extent of surgery (mastectomy versus lumpectomy) and radiation therapy use were not associated with improved survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival in patients with primary tumors 5 cm and greater. Conclusions: The extent of surgery is not associated with improved survival in women with LBA, and patients may consider breast-conservation surgery. Adjuvant therapies are not associated with improved survival, with the exception of possible role of adjuvant chemotherapy in large primary tumors (5 cm or greater). Further clinical studies are needed to determine the impact of these treatments on local control, progression-free survival, and patients’ quality of life.

With focus group input, we developed a brochure to improve awareness of the frequency of abnormal results. This study explored the brochure's acceptability and effect on understanding risk and breast cancer fears among black mammography patients at an urban safety-net breast imaging center in Miami, Florida. Methods A randomized controlled trial of the brochure (plus the standard result notification letter) versus usual care (standard notification letter alone). Black English-speaking women with an incomplete mammography result were randomized to the intervention or control group. Consenting participants completed a telephone questionnaire. Outcomes included awareness of result, anxiety level, and brochure acceptability. The χ 2 or Fisher exact test was used and a univariate logistic regression was performed for intervention and control odds ratios. Results A total of 106 women were randomly selected to receive the brochure plus the letter or the letter alone. One chose to opt out; a minimum of three attempts were made to reach each of the remaining 105 women by telephone. Verbal communication was established with 59 of the randomized women, and 51 of those women agreed to participate in a survey to evaluate the brochure. There was no significant difference between the surveyed groups in knowledge of the result and follow-up plan. Surveyed intervention subjects were more likely to agree that ""it is very common for women to have to follow up after a mammogram"" (odds ratio [OR] 25.91, P = 0.029) and less likely to agree with the statement ""getting a follow-up mammogram is scary"" (OR 0.24, P = 0.021). Most intervention subjects said the pamphlet helped them understand their result ""a lot"" (79%, 19) and viewed it as ""extremely"" or ""mostly"" clear (96%, 23). Intervention subjects also voiced greater awareness of a telephone number they could call for more information about cancer (OR 11.38, P = 0.029). Conclusions A culturally tailored brochure explaining the frequency of abnormal mammograms was well received by women at a large safety-net health system.

Low-molecular-weight heparin remains the standard of care for cancer patients with venous thromboembolism, with warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, as an alternative. Clear recommendations do not exist for patients with both active cancer and non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The objectives of this study were to report safety and efficacy outcomes of direct oral anticoagulants, low-molecular-weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonist in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Methods: Retrospective chart review of adult cancer patients from 2012 to 2015 who received an antineoplastic agent and an anticoagulant. Results: A total of 258 patients were reviewed: 80 patients in direct oral anticoagulant group, 95 patients in low-molecular-weight heparin group, and 83 patients in vitamin K antagonist group. Sixty-seven percent of patients were on an anticoagulant for acute or chronic venous thromboembolism. Major bleeding events were similar across the groups (15% direct oral anticoagulant vs 17% low-molecular-weight heparin vs 18% vitamin K antagonist). The most common type of major bleeding event was gastrointestinal bleeding. A total of five fatal bleeding events occurred. Venous thromboembolism recurrence rates were higher in both direct oral anticoagulant (18%) and low-molecular-weight heparin (12%) groups while lower in vitamin K antagonist group (10%) compared to previous studies. Conclusions: Cancer patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants, low-molecular-weight heparin, or vitamin K antagonist had similar rates of major bleeding events, with gastrointestinal bleeding being the most common event. Venous thromboembolism recurrence rates were higher in direct oral anticoagulant and low-molecular-weight heparin groups than prior studies.

We sought to determine agreement between self-reported and registry-recorded site-specific cancer diagnoses in a cohort of Alaska Native people. We linked cancer history information from the Alaska Education and Research Towards Health (EARTH) cohort and the Alaska Native Tumor Registry (ANTR), and calculated validity measures (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, kappa). Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess independent associations of demographic variables with incorrect reporting. We found that among Alaska EARTH participants, 140 self-reported a history of cancer, and 99 matched the ANTR. Sensitivity ranged from 79% (colorectal cancer) to 100% (prostate cancer); specificity was over 98% for all-sites examined. Kappa was higher among prostate and female breast cancers (κ=0.86) than colorectal cancers (κ=0.63). Women (odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval [CI]): 2.8 (1.49–5.31)) and participants who were older than 50 years (OR (95% CI): 2.8 (1.53–4.12)) were more likely to report incorrectly. These data showed good agreement between self-reported and registry-recorded cancer history. This may be attributed to the high quality of care within the Alaska Tribal Health System, which strongly values patient-provider relationships and the provision of culturally appropriate care. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our screening mammography database from August 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, including full field digital mammograms (FFDM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) mammograms. False positive (FP) exams were defined as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 1 or 2 assessments at diagnostic imaging with 1 year cancer-free follow-up, Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System 3 assessment at diagnostic imaging with 2 years cancer free follow-up, or biopsy with benign pathology. True positives were defined as malignant pathology on biopsy or surgical excision. We evaluated the association of FP recalls with multiple patient-level factors and imaging features. Results: A total of 22,055 screening mammograms were performed, and 1887 patients were recalled (recall rate 8.6%). Recall rate was lower for DBT than full field digital mammograms (8.0% vs 10.6%, p < 0.001). FP results were lower if prior mammograms were available (90.8% vs 95.8%, p = 0.02), and if there was a previous benign breast biopsy (87.6% vs 92.9%, p = 0.01). Mean age for the FP group was lower than the true positive group (56.1 vs 62.9 years, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in FP recalls based on history of high-risk lesions, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, hormone use, breast density, race, or body mass index. Conclusion: FP recalls were significantly less likely with DBT, in older women, in patients with prior mammograms available for comparison, and in patients with histories of benign breast biopsy. This study supports the importance of using DBT in the screening setting and obtaining prior mammograms for comparison. © 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061404237

Methods All patients undergoing OCR with postoperative adjuvant radiation at a single institution between 1997 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Women who received adjuvant chemotherapy or experienced delays in radiation therapy due to nonsurgical reasons were excluded from our analysis. Comparisons were made between the time to radiation for patients with surgical complications and those without. Results One hundred eighteen patients were included. Twenty-six (22.0%) experienced a surgical complication. Complications included cellulitis, delayed healing, seroma, wound breakdown, and wound dehiscence. Postoperative complications resulted in a significantly different median time interval for initiation of radiation (74 days vs 54 days, P < 0.001) compared to those without a complication.

Conclusion Postoperative complications following OCR procedures were associated with an increased time to initiation of adjuvant radiation therapy regardless of whether or not the complication required reoperation. This needs to be taken into consideration when planning these combined procedures with every attempt made to minimize complications through patient selection and surgical technique. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is strongly associated with many types of cancer. Few studies have examined the relationship between bariatric surgery and cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through 2014 using data from a large integrated health insurance and care delivery systems with 5 study sites. The study included 22,198 subjects who had bariatric surgery and 66,427 nonsurgical subjects matched on sex, age, study site, body mass index, and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine incident cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery compared to the matched nonsurgical patients. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, we identified 2543 incident cancers. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery had a 33% lower hazard of developing any cancer during follow-up [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60, 0.74, P < 0.001) compared with matched patients with severe obesity who did not undergo bariatric surgery, and results were even stronger when the outcome was restricted to obesity-associated cancers (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51, 0.69, P < 0.001). Among the obesity-associated cancers, the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44, 0.77, P < 0.001), colon cancer (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36, 0.97, P = 0.04), endometrial cancer (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.67, P < 0.001), and pancreatic cancer (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.97, P = 0.04) was each statistically significantly lower among those who had undergone bariatric surgery compared with matched nonsurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multisite cohort of patients with severe obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of incident cancer, particularly obesity-associated cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer. More research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms through which bariatric surgery lowers cancer risk.","Final",,2-s2.0-85049518769

Quantitative items included demographic questions and the Life Impact Checklist. Qualitative questions were designed to explore the bidirectional impact between the patient and specific contexts including spirituality/faith, the spousal/partner relationship, and the family. A cross-sectional descriptive approach was used to evaluate the quantitative items and the constant comparative method guided the analysis of open-ended questions.ResultAmong 116 participants (mean age 58.4 years), the majority were female (66.7%) with breast cancer (27.9%). Nearly one-half the respondents endorsed a positive impact of cancer on their spirituality/faith, but qualitative results suggested less of a bidirectional impact. The importance of the spouse/partner during the cancer experience was emphasized, including the subthemes of instrumental and emotional support; however, there was often a negative impact of cancer on the spouse/partner relationship, including sexual functioning. Survivors indicated family members provided instrumental and emotional support, but not as regularly or directly as a spouse/partner.Significance of resultsSocial contexts are important among cancer survivors, with many cancer survivors relying more on their spouse/partner than other family members for support. The cancer experience is stressful not only for survivors, but also for individuals in their social contexts and relationships. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062676446

The recent use of multikinase inhibitors has also met limited success. An alternative approach relies on drugs that induce cell differentiation, as the ensuing increased expression of the cotransporter for sodium and iodine (NIS) may partially restore sensitivity to radioiodine. The inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway has shown some efficacy in this context. Aggressive thyroid tumors overexpress the isoform-A of the insulin receptor (IR-A) and its ligand IGF-2; this IGF-2/IR-A loop is associated with de-differentiation and stem-like phenotype, resembling RAI-refractory tumors. Importantly, IR-A has been shown to be positively modulated by the non-integrin collagen receptor DDR1 in human breast cancer. Using undifferentiated human thyroid cancer cells, we now evaluated the effects of DDR1 on IGF-2/IR-A loop and on markers of cell differentiation and stemness. DDR1 silencing or downregulation caused significant reduction of IR-A and IGF-2 expression, and concomitant increased levels of differentiation markers (NIS, Tg, TSH, TPO). Conversely, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Vimentin, Snail-2, Zeb1, Zeb2 and N-Cadherin) and stemness (OCT-4, SOX-2, ABCG2 and Nanog) decreased. These effects were collagen independent. In contrast, overexpression of either DDR1 or its kinase-inactive variant K618A DDR1-induced changes suggestive of less differentiated and stem-like phenotype. Collagen stimulation was uneffective. In conclusion, in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, DDR1 silencing or downregulation blocks the IGF-2/IR-A autocrine loop and induces cellular differentiation. These results may open novel therapeutic approaches for thyroid cancer. © 2019 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056942731

Despite good outcomes and high patient satisfaction, there are little national data on the predictors that lead to complications in this patient population. We accessed a national outcomes database to examine these factors. Methods: This is a retrospective study examining the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2006 to 2015. Patients who underwent primary breast reduction were identified. Patients who underwent any cancer-related procedures were excluded. We identified patient-related and procedure-related factors for analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of complications. Results: In total, 16,812 individual cases were identified. The overall complication rate for the cohort was 6.2%, and the major complication rate was 3.0%. Diabetes, bleeding disorder, hypertension, obesity, smoking, steroid use, and prolonged operative time were associated with increased risk of complications (p < 0.05). Concurrent body contouring was a predictor of increased major complications; however, liposuction was not. Conclusions: Common surgical risk factors are associated with complications in breast reduction surgery. Although liposuction is not an independent risk factor, concurrent body contouring is associated with increased complications.

Inflammatory markers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), are readily available. The authors investigated the association between these markers and clinical outcomes of patients with advanced-stage cancer who received IO. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 90 patients with advanced cancer who received treatment on phase 1 clinical trials of IO-based treatment regimens. NLR, MLR, and PLR values were log-transformed and treated as continuous variables for each patient. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and clinical benefit were used to measure clinical outcomes. For univariate associations and multivariable analyses, Cox proportional-hazards models or logistic regression models were used. Results: The median patient age was 63 years, and most were men (59%). The most common histologies were melanoma (33%) and gastrointestinal cancers (22%). High baseline NLR, MLR, and PLR values were associated significantly with worse OS and PFS (P <.05) and a lower chance of benefit (NLR and PLR; P <.05). Increased NLR, MLR, and PLR values 6 weeks after baseline were associated with shorter OS and PFS (P ≤.052). Conclusions: Baseline and early changes in NLR, MLR, and PLR values were strongly associated with clinical outcomes in patients who received IO-based treatment regimens on phase 1 trials. Confirmation in a homogenous patient population treated on late-stage trials or outside of trial settings is warranted. These values may warrant consideration for inclusion when risk stratifying patients enrolled onto phase 1 clinical trials of IO agents. © 2018 American Cancer Society","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85055195762

However, a proportion of high-grade ductal carcinoma shows reduced/loss of E-cadherin. In this study, we assessed the underlying mechanisms and molecular implications of E-cadherin loss in invasive ductal carcinoma. This study used large, well-characterized cohorts of early-stage breast cancer-evaluated E-cadherin expression via various platforms including immunohistochemistry, microarray analysis using Illumina HT-12 v3, copy number analysis using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays, and next-generation sequencing for differential gene expression. Our results showed 27% of high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma showed reduced/loss of E-cadherin membranous expression. CDH1 copy number loss was in 21% of invasive ductal carcinoma, which also showed low CDH1 mRNA expression (p = 0.003). CDH1 copy number was associated with copy number loss of TP53, ATM, BRCA1, and BRCA2 (p < 0.001). Seventy-nine percent of invasive ductal carcinoma with reduced CDH1 mRNA expression showed elevated expression of E-cadherin transcription suppressors TWIST2, ZEB2, NFKB1, LLGL2, CTNNB1 (p < 0.01). Reduced/loss E-cadherin expression was associated with differential expression of 2143 genes including those regulating Wnt (FZD2, GNG5, HLTF, WNT2, and CER1) and PIK3-AKT (FGFR2, GNF5, GNGT1, IFNA17, and IGF1) signaling pathways. Interestingly, key genes differentially expressed between invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal tumors did not show association with E-cadherin loss in invasive ductal carcinoma. We conclude that E-cadherin loss in invasive ductal carcinoma is likely a consequence of genomic instability occurring during carcinogenesis.

We hypothesized that cancer stem cells (CSCs) rely on SAM biosynthesis and that the combination of methionine depletion and MAT2A inhibition would eradicate CSCs. Methods: Human triple (ER/PR/HER2)-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) cell lines were cultured as CSC-enriched mammospheres in control or methionine-free media. MAT2A was inhibited with siRNAs or cycloleucine. The effects of methionine restriction and/or MAT2A inhibition on the formation of mammospheres, the expression of CSC markers (CD44 hi /C24 low ), MAT2A and CSC transcriptional regulators, apoptosis induction and histone modifications were determined. A murine model of metastatic TNBC was utilized to evaluate the effects of dietary methionine restriction, MAT2A inhibition and the combination. Results: Methionine restriction inhibited mammosphere formation and reduced the CD44 hi /C24 low CSC population; these effects were partly rescued by SAM. Methionine depletion induced MAT2A expression (mRNA and protein) and sensitized CSCs to inhibition of MAT2A (siRNAs or cycloleucine). Cycloleucine enhanced the effects of methionine depletion on H3K4me3 demethylation and suppression of Sox9 expression. Dietary methionine restriction induced MAT2A expression in mammary tumors, and the combination of methionine restriction and cycloleucine was more effective than either alone at suppressing primary and lung metastatic tumor burden in a murine TNBC model. Conclusions: Our findings point to SAM biosynthesis as a unique metabolic vulnerability of CSCs that can be targeted by combining methionine depletion with MAT2A inhibition to eradicate drug-resistant CSCs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85060996481

Understanding when and if specific types of cessation resources are used can help with planning interventions to more effectively decrease smoking among all cancer survivors, but there is a lack of research on smoking cessation modalities used among cancer survivors. Methods: Kentucky Cancer Registry data on incident lung, colorectal, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer cases diagnosed 2007–2011, were linked with health administrative claims data (Medicaid, Medicare, private insurers) to examine the prevalence of smoking and use of smoking cessation aids 1 year prior and 1 year following the cancer diagnosis. TACs included colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancers; nTAC included breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Results: There were 10,033 TAC and 13,670 nTAC survivors. Smoking before diagnosis was significantly higher among TAC survivors (p < 0.0001). Among TAC survivors, smoking before diagnosis was significantly higher among persons who: were males (83%), aged 45–64 (83%), of unknown marital status (84%), had very low education (78%), had public insurance (89%), Medicaid (85%) or were uninsured (84%). Smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy were more common among TAC than nTAC survivors (p < 0.01 and p = 0.05, respectively). Discussion: While smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy were higher among TAC survivors, reducing smoking among all cancer survivors remains a priority, given cancer survivors are at increased risk for subsequent chronic diseases, including cancer. Tobacco cessation among all cancer survivors (not just those with TAC) can help improve prognosis, quality of life and reduce the risk of further disease. Health care providers can recommend for individual, group and telephone counseling and/or pharmacotherapy recommendations. These could also be included in survivorship care plans. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061734577

Patient desire for breast conservation has increased the interest in extreme oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (EOBCS) to avoid mastectomy; however, perioperative outcomes in this population have not been well described. Methods: This is an observational cohort of breast cancer patients with multiple lesions and disease span ≥5 cm who underwent EOBCS. Patient demographics, disease span, margin width, mastectomy and re-excision rates, and cosmesis were evaluated. Results: One hundred-eleven patients underwent EOBCS between 2012 and 2017. Eighty-two patients presented with multifocal or multicentric disease with an average of 3.2 lesions per breast spanning 57.1 ± 23.6 mm. Eighteen patients presented with unifocal tumors measuring an average of 67.6 mm (range 50–160 mm) on imaging. Eleven patients with an imaging size of <5 cm had a disease span ≥5 cm on final pathology. No tumor on ink occurred in 87 (78.3%) patients. Fifty-seven (51.4%) patients had additional surgery for inadequate margins. Fifteen (12.6%) patients elected to have mastectomy while 42 (37.8%) patients opted for re-excision. Good to excellent cosmetic results were reported in 95% of patients who ultimately achieved breast conservation. Recurrence rate was 1.1% in patients who completed EOBCS and adjuvant radiation therapy. Conclusion: EOBCS can allow for breast conservation in patients who are traditionally counseled to undergo mastectomy. Although the re-excision rate was significant, most patients ultimately achieved breast conservation with adequate margins. Further study is warranted to determine the long-term oncologic outcomes of this approach. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061379210

We sought to define the mutational signatures of i) endometrioid and serous endometrial carcinomas (ECs), stratified into the four molecular subtypes, ii) uterine carcinosarcomas, and iii) matched primary and metastatic ECs. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing MC3 data from primary endometrioid and serous carcinomas (n = 232) and uterine carcinosarcomas (n = 57) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and matched primary and metastatic ECs (n = 61, 26 patients) were reanalyzed, subjected to mutational signature analysis using deconstructSigs, and correlated with clinicopathologic and genomic data. Results: POLE (ultramutated) and MSI (hypermutated) molecular subtypes displayed dominant mutational signatures associated with POLE mutations (15/17 cases) and microsatellite instability (55/65 cases), respectively. Most endometrioid and serous carcinomas of copy-number low (endometrioid) and copy-number high (serous-like) molecular subtypes, and carcinosarcomas displayed a dominant aging-associated signature 1. Only 15% (9/60) of copy-number high (serous-like) ECs had a dominant signature 3 (homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency (HRD)-related), a prevalence significantly lower than that found in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (54%, p < 0.001) or basal-like breast cancers (46%, p < 0.001). Shifts from aging- or POLE- to MSI-related mutational processes were observed in the progression from primary to metastatic ECs in a subset of cases. Conclusions: The mutational processes underpinning ECs vary even among tumors of the same TCGA molecular subtype and in the progression from primary to metastatic ECs. Only a minority of copy-number high (serous-like) ECs display genomics features of HRD and would likely benefit from HRD-directed therapies. © 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85056246361

We sought to determine the prevalence and significance of germline cancer susceptibility gene variants in PDAC with paired somatic and survival analyses. Methods: Using a customized next-generation sequencing panel, germline/somatic DNA was analyzed from 289 patients with resected PDAC ascertained without preselection for high-risk features (e.g., young age, personal/family history). All identified variants were assessed for pathogenicity. Outcomes were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: We found that 28/289 (9.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5–13.7%) patients carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants, including 21 (7.3%) dsDDR gene variants (3 BRCA1, 4 BRCA2, 14 other dsDDR genes [ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51C]), 3 Lynch syndrome, and 4 other genes (APC p.I1307K, CDKN2A, TP53). Somatic sequencing and immunohistochemistry identified second hits in the tumor in 12/27 (44.4%) patients with germline variants (1 failed sequencing). Compared with noncarriers, patients with germline dsDDR gene variants had superior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% CI 0.30–0.99; P = 0.05). Conclusion: Nearly 10% of PDAC patients harbor germline variants, although the majority lack somatic second hits, the therapeutic significance of which warrants further study. © 2018, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.","Final",,2-s2.0-85049198835

In our previous study, we described the radiosynthesis and preliminary evaluation of l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp for PET imaging of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo imaging mechanism and further evaluate this radiotracer in more wide range types of cancers including prostate cancer, lung cancer, and glioma. Procedures: The mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 prostate cancer, subcutaneous H2009 and H460 lung cancers, subcutaneous MDA-MB-231, orthotopic A549 lung cancer, and intracranial 73C glioma were employed to evaluate l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp for PET imaging of cancer. The in vivo catabolism of l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp in the tumor was studied by analysis of PC-3 extracts with radio-HPLC. Results: Small animal PET/CT imaging of l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp visualized all tumors in these different mouse models with high accumulations of radioactivity in PC-3 (7.5 ± 0.6 % ID/g), H2009 (5.3 ± 0.8 % ID/g), H460 (9.0 ± 1.4 % ID/g), A549 (4.5 ± 0.5 % ID/g), and 73C (4.1 ± 0.7 % ID/g) tumors. The radio-HPLC analysis of PC-3 tumor extracts revealed that about 30 % of l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp was converted into a highly polar radioactive metabolite. The uptake in H460 cancer was about 1.7-fold higher than that in H2009 cancer, which indicated l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp could differentiate these subtypes of lung cancers (H2009 and H460) by imaging quantification. Furthermore, small animal PET/CT imaging in intracranial glioma revealed l-1-[ 18 F]FETrp could pass blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulate in glioma with a favorable imaging contrast (tumor-to-brain 2.9).

However, cancer communicators have yet to systematically leverage these naturally occurring interventions on social media as these events are difficult to identify as they are unfolding and little research has analyzed their effect on social media conversations. In this study, we add to the research by analyzing how a celebrity cancer announcement influenced Twitter conversations in terms of the volume of social media messages and the type of content. Over a 9-day period, during which actor Ben Stiller announced that he had been treated for prostate cancer, we collected 1.2 million Twitter messages about cancer. We conducted automated content analyses to identify how often common cancer sites (prostate, breast, colon, or lung) were discussed. Then, we used manual content analysis on a sample of messages to identify cancer continuum content (awareness, prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life). Chi-square analyses were implemented to evaluate changes in cancer site and cancer continuum content before and after the announcement. We found that messages related to prostate cancer increased significantly more than expected for 2 days following Stiller’s announcement. However, the number of cancer messages that described other cancer locations either did not increase or did not increase by the same magnitude. In terms of message content, results showed larger than expected increases in diagnosis messages. These results suggest opportunities to shape social media conversations following celebrity cancer announcements and increase prevention and early detection messages. © The Author(s) 2019.","Final",,2-s2.0-85062338223

We sought to develop a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument that allows patients to voice their symptom burdens and facilitate timing of discussions. Subjects, Materials, and Methods: A seven-item PRO instrument (Cota Patient Assessed Symptom Score-7 item [CPASS-7]) covering physical performance status, pain, burden, and depression was administered (September 2015 through October 2016) with correlation to overall survival, correcting for time to complete survey since diagnosis. Results: A total of 1,191 patients completed CPASS-7 at a median of 560 days following the diagnosis of advanced cancer. Of these patients, 49% were concerned that they could not do the things they wanted; 35% reported decreased performance status. Financial toxicity was reported by 39% of patients, with family burdens noted in 25%. Although depression was reported by 15%, 43% reported lack of pleasure. Pain was reported by 33%. The median CPASS-7 total symptom burden score was 16 (possible 0–112). With a median follow-up of 15 months from initial survey, 46% had died. Patients with symptom burden scores <29 and ≥29 had a 6-month overall survival rate of 87% and 67%, respectively, and 12-month survival rates of 72% and 50%. A one-point score increase resulted in a 1.8% increase in expected hazard. Conclusion: Patients with advanced cancer with higher levels of symptom burden, as self-reported on the CPASS-7, had inferior survival. The PRO facilitates identification of patients appropriate for reassessment of treatment goals and potentially palliative and end-of-life care in response to symptom burden concerns. Implications for Practice: A seven-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument was administered to 1,191 patients with advanced cancers. Patients self-reporting higher levels of physical and psychological symptom burden had inferior overall survival rates. High individual item symptom PRO responses should serve as a useful trigger to initiate supportive interventions, but when scores indicate global problems, discussions regarding end-of-life care might be appropriate. © AlphaMed Press 2018","Final",,2-s2.0-85054836141

At present, the changes in integrative brain function that underlie such dysfunction remain poorly understood. Recent developments in neuroimaging suggest that patterns of functional connectivity can provide a broadly applicable neuromarker of cognitive performance and other psychometric measures. The current study used multivariate analysis methods to identify patterns of disruption in resting state functional connectivity of the brain due to chemotherapy and the degree to which the disruptions can be linked to behavioral measures of distress and cognitive performance. Sixty two women (22 healthy control, 18 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 22 treated without chemotherapy) were evaluated with neurocognitive measures followed by self-report questionnaires and open eyes resting-state fMRI scanning at three time points: diagnosis (M0, pre-adjuvant treatment), 1 month (M1), and 7 months (M7) after treatment. The results indicated deficits in cognitive health of breast cancer patients immediately after chemotherapy that improved over time. This psychological trajectory was paralleled by a disruption and later recovery of resting-state functional connectivity, mostly in the parietal and frontal brain regions. Mediation analysis showed that the functional connectivity alteration pattern is a separable treatment symptom from the decreased cognitive health. Current study indicates that more targeted support for patients should be developed to ameliorate these multi-faceted side effects of chemotherapy treatment on neural functioning and cognitive health. © 2019 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059815004

Tumor neoangiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, may be used as a prognostic marker for cancer progression. Clinical practice uses dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to detect cancers based on increased blood flow and capillary permeability. However, DCE-MRI requires repeated injections of contrast media. Therefore we explored the use of noninvasive time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography for serial studies of mouse mammary glands to measure the number and size of arteries feeding mammary glands with and without cancer. Virgin female C3(1) SV40 TAg mice (n=9), aged 18-20 weeks, were imaged on a 9.4 Tesla small animal scanner. Multislice T 2 -weighted (T2W) images and TOF-MRI angiograms were acquired over inguinal mouse mammary glands. The data were analyzed to determine tumor burden in each mammary gland and the volume of arteries feeding each mammary gland. After in vivo MRI, inguinal mammary glands were excised and fixed in formalin for histology. TOF angiography detected arteries with a diameter as small as 0.1 mm feeding the mammary glands. A significant correlation (r=0.79; p&lt; 0.0001) was found between tumor volume and the arterial blood volume measured in mammary glands. Mammary arterial blood volumes ranging from 0.08 mm 3 to 3.81 mm 3 were measured. Tumors and blood vessels found on in vivo T2W and TOF images, respectively, were confirmed with ex vivo histological images. These results demonstrate increased recruitment of arteries to mammary glands with cancer, likely associated with neoangiogenesis. Neoangiogenesis may be detected by TOF angiography without injection of contrast agents. This would be very useful in mouse models where repeat placement of I.V. lines is challenging. In addition, analogous methods could be tested in humans to evaluate the vasculature of suspicious lesions without using contrast agents. © 2019 Devkumar Mustafi et al.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060792376

Our objective was to examine whether medical oncologists’ prescribing of drugs and services for older adult patients with advanced cancer is used more in physicians’ offices compared with hospital outpatient departments. METHODS This was a retrospective comparative study. SEER-Medicare data (2004 to 2011) were used to identify Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with advanced breast, colon, esophagus, non–small-cell lung, pancreatic, or stomach cancer. Between physicians’ offices and hospital outpatient departments, we compared use of selected likely low-value supportive drugs, low-value therapeutic drugs, chemotherapy-related hospitalizations, and hospice. We used hierarchical modeling to assess differences between settings to account for correlation within physicians. RESULTS Compared with patients treated in a hospital outpatient department, those treated in a physician’s office setting were more likely to receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.53 to 1.94) and granulocyte colony–stimulating factors (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.38). For combination chemotherapy and nanoparticle albumin-bound–paclitaxel in patients with breast cancer, there was a trend toward higher use in physicians’ offices, although this was not statistically significant. Chemotherapy-related hospitalizations and hospice did not vary by setting. CONCLUSION We found somewhat higher use of several drugs for patients with advanced cancer in physicians’ office settings compared with hospital outpatient departments.

This study aims at understanding the molecular features within CTCs, in relation to their metastatic potential. Using in vitro CTC models, in which breast cancer cell lines were cultured in non-adherent conditions simulating the microenvironment in the blood stream, we found that the suspension culture resulted in resistance to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated cell death. Such a resistance was directly correlated with a reduction in surface and total levels of DR5 protein. In the non-adherent state, the cells underwent a rapid autophagic flux, characterized by an accumulation of autophagosome organelles. Notably, DR5 was translocated to the autophagosomes and underwent a lysosomal degradation. Our data suggest that CTCs may evade the TNF cytokine-mediated immune surveillance through a downregulation of the death receptor (DR) expression.

Methods: This is a retrospective review of 407 patients within Kaiser Permanente Northern California diagnosed between 2012 and 2013. The study focused on patients presenting with a mass lesion and who were diagnosed with a benign papillary breast lesion (BPBL) on IGCNB. Patients who did not have surgical excision of the IGCNB papilloma were followed for at least 2 years. Results: A total of 327 patients (80%) underwent surgical excision, 61 patients (15%) had follow-up imaging, and 19 patients (5%) had no surgery or imaging. Overall among women with surgical excision, 9.5% had a high-risk lesion, 3.4% had in situ cancer, and 2.4% had invasive cancer. An upgrade to an in situ cancer or invasive cancer was more common among women with a lesion greater than 1 cm, a palpable breast mass, age > 50 years, or if the lesion was > 5 cm from the nipple. No cancers were diagnosed in 61 women followed by imaging surveillance. Conclusions: This is the largest, single-cohort study of benign papillary mass lesions diagnosed on IGCNB. On surgical excision, the overall rate of upgrade to in situ cancer and invasive cancer was low, and almost all cancers diagnosed had favorable features. Because no cancers were found in women who were followed by imaging, we conclude that outcomes for BPBL diagnosed on IGCNB are favorable whether surgical excision or surveillance is the treatment choice. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061247065

Pyridazinones are well known for their anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular activities, among others. In this study, we evaluated the anti-cancer activity of a new pyridazinone derivative and propose it as a potential anti-neoplastic agent in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Pyr-1 cytotoxicity was assessed on several human cancer and two non-cancerous cell lines by the DNS assay. Pyr-1 demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against 22 human cancer cell lines, exhibiting the most favorable selective cytotoxicity on leukemia (CEM and HL-60), breast (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468), and lung (A-549) cancer cell lines, when compared with non-cancerous breast epithelial MCF-10A cells. Analyses of apoptosis/necrosis pathways, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondria health, caspase-3 activation, and cell cycle profile were performed via flow cytometry. Both hmox-1 RNA and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting assays, respectively. Pyr-1 induced apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells as confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and disrupted cell cycle progression. Additionally, it was determined that Pyr-1 generates oxidative and proteotoxic stress by provoking the accumulation of ROS, resulting in the overexpression of the stress-related hmox-1 mRNA transcripts and protein and a marked increase in poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Our data demonstrate that Pyr-1 induces cell death via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by accumulating ROS and by impairing proteasome activity. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062726282

The NCDB data include 31 million records for patients diagnosed between 1985–2015. A Participant User File based on a subset of these data has been available to researchers at facilities accredited by the Commission on Cancer since 2010. This study aimed to compare the number of incident cancer cases in the NCDB with a national population cancer registry. Methods: Incident cancer cases in the NCDB in 2012–2014 were compared with the number of cancer cases in the United States Cancer Statistics data for the 2012–2014 diagnosis years. Comparisons were made by primary site and other factors. Results: In 2012–2014, the NCDB captured 72% of the cancer cases in the United States, which was slightly higher than the 67% and 69% reported respectively in two prior assessments. Among the top 10 major cancer sites, the highest coverage (80%) was found for breast cancer, and the lowest was found for melanoma of the skin (52%) and prostate (58%). Colon, bladder, and kidney and renal pelvis cancers had relatively high coverage of 71%, 70% and 78%, respectively, whereas lung and bronchus had slightly lower coverage (65%).

Extraordinary progress made in analysis of common variation with GWAS methodology does not provide sufficient resolution to understand rare variation. To fulfill missing classification for rare germline variation we assembled dataset of whole exome sequences from>2000 patients (selected cases tested negative for candidate genes and unselected cases) with different types of cancers (breast cancer, colon cancer, and cutaneous and ocular melanomas) matched to more than 7000 non-cancer controls and analyzed germline variation in known cancer predisposing genes to identify common properties of disease-associated DNA variation and aid the future searches for new cancer susceptibility genes. Cancer predisposing genes were divided into non-overlapping classes according to the mode of inheritance of the related cancer syndrome or known tumor suppressor activity. Out of all classes only genes linked to dominant syndromes presented significant rare germline variants enrichment in cases. Separate analysis of protein-truncating and missense variation in this list of genes confirmed significant prevalence of protein-truncating variants in cases only in loss-of-function tolerant genes (pLI < 0.1), while ultra-rare missense variants were significantly overrepresented in cases only in constrained genes (pLI > 0.9). In addition to findings in genetically enriched cases, we observed significant burden of rare variation in unselected cases, suggesting substantial role of inherited variation even in relatively late cancer manifestation.

Snail1 is short-lived in normal epithelial cells as a consequence of its coordinated and continuous ubiquitination by several F-box–specific E3 ligases, but its degradation is prevented in cancer cells and in activated fibroblasts. Here, we performed an siRNA screen and identified USP27X as a deubiquitinase that increases Snail1 stability. Expression of USP27X in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumors positively correlated with Snail1 expression levels. Accordingly, downregulation of USP27X decreased Snail1 protein in several tumor cell lines. USP27X depletion impaired Snail1-dependent cell migration and invasion and metastasis formation and increased cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. USP27X was upregulated by TGFb during EMT and was required for TGFb-induced expression of Snail1 and other mesenchymal markers in epithelial cells and CAF. In agreement with this, depletion of USP27X prevented TGFb-induced EMT and fibroblast activation. Collectively, these results indicate that USP27X is an essential protein controlling Snail1 expression and function and may serve as a target for inhibition of Snail1-dependent tumoral invasion and chemoresistance. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059482569

The term genotoxic estrogens describes mutagenic metabolites, including oestrogen catechols and quinones, which have been linked to breast carcinogenesis in post-menopausal women. We aimed to assess whether the route of administration of 17β oestradiol (E 2 ) affects the accumulation of genotoxic oestrogen metabolites in a model of ovarian failure in young girls with Turner syndrome. Methods: Stored plasma samples obtained at 0 and 12 months were used from 40 adolescents with Turner syndrome who participated in a 12 months randomized controlled trial of the metabolic impact of E 2 orally (2 mg/d) vs transdermally (100 µg/d); dose escalation allowed matching of unconjugated E 2 levels in the parent study. We measured 12 oestrogen metabolites (total concentrations = conjugated and unconjugated) using a highly sensitive LCMSMS assay. Results from 48 normally menstruating adolescents were used for comparison. Results: After treatment, least square mean (SE) total E 2 concentrations were higher in the oral vs transdermal group (6784 pmol/L vs 1123 [1614], P &lt; 0.0001), as was oestrone (E 1 ) (91 060 pmol/L vs 19 278 [16 534], P &lt; 0.0001). Also, higher after oral treatment were catechol-oestrogens 4-hydroxy-E 2 (149 vs 28 [±49] pmol/L), 2-hydroxy-E 2 (300 vs 76 [±52]), 4-hydroxy-E 1 (450 vs 105 [±113]), 2-hydroxy-E 1 (3094 vs 740 [±684]) and 16α-hydroxy-E 1 (3,007 vs 157 [±534]) (&lt;0.001 between groups). Levels were much closer to controls in the transdermal group. Conclusions: Common feminizing doses of oral oestradiol for 12 months result in substantial accumulation of unphysiologic, genotoxic oestrogens compared to transdermal oestradiol, expanding concerns about oral oestrogens’ first hepatic passage. Further studies assessing long-term risks of these metabolites in women taking different forms of oestrogen are needed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85055568114

In this article, we present our recent applications of Bayesian network modeling to pathology informatics. Methods: Bayesian networks (BNs) are probabilistic graphical models that represent domain knowledge and allow investigators to process this knowledge following sound rules of probability theory. BNs can be built based on expert opinion as well as learned from accumulating data sets. BN modeling is now recognized as a suitable approach for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty. Over the last two decades BN have been successfully applied to many studies on medical prognosis and diagnosis. Results: Based on data and expert knowledge, we have constructed several BN models to assess patient risk for subsequent specific histopathologic diagnoses and their related prognosis in gynecological cytopathology and breast pathology. These models include the Pittsburgh Cervical Cancer Screening Model assessing risk for histopathologic diagnoses of cervical precancer and cervical cancer, modeling of the significance of benign-appearing endometrial cells in Pap tests, diagnostic modeling to determine whether adenocarcinoma in tissue specimens is of endometrial or endocervical origin, and models to assess risk for recurrence of invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. Conclusions: Bayesian network models can be used as powerful and flexible risk assessment tools on large clinical datasets and can quantitatively identify variables that are of greatest significance in predicting specific histopathologic diagnoses and their related prognosis. Resulting BN models are able to provide individualized quantitative risk assessments and prognostication for specific abnormal findings commonly reported in gynecological cytopathology and breast pathology. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85056748649

We model the longitudinal measurement process using a proportional odds model, which accommodates the within-dyad interdependence using the concept of the actor-partner interdependence effects, as well as dyad-specific random effects. We model informative dropouts and intermittent missing data using a transition model, which shares the same set of random effects as the longitudinal measurement model. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation studies.

Most of the established literature utilizes partial area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with restrictions only on false positive rate (FPR), called FPR pAUC, as a performance measure. However, its indirect control on true positive rate (TPR) is conceptually and practically misleading. In this paper, a novel and intuitive performance measure, named as two-way pAUC, is proposed, which directly quantifies partial area under ROC curve with explicit restrictions on both TPR and FPR. To estimate two-way pAUC, we devise a nonparametric estimator. Based on the estimator, a bootstrap-assisted testing method for two-way pAUC comparison is established. Moreover, to evaluate possible covariate effects on two-way pAUC, a regression analysis framework is constructed. Asymptotic normalities of the methods are provided.

Materials and Methods: Using the up-to-date GLOBOCAN estimates for 2018, we describe the cancer burden including key patterns for the major cancer sites among adults aged 65 years and older in Latin America and the Caribbean. We also predict the future burden in 2040 by applying population projections, assuming no changes in incidence rates over time. Results: In 2018, an estimated 679,000 new cancer cases occurred among older adults in LAC, representing almost half (48%) of the total incidence burden (43% in Central America, 49% in South America, and 52% in the Caribbean). Prostate, colorectum, and lung were the most common cancers among older males in South America and the Caribbean, with non-melanoma skin cancer ranking third in Central America. Among older females, the most common sites were breast, colorectum, and non-melanoma skin cancer, except in the Caribbean, where lung cancer ranked third. Overall, the number of new cancer cases among older adults in the region is expected to double by 2040, reaching 1.6 million new cases.

To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with markers of DDTs (p,p’-DDT and the primary metabolite of p,p’-DDT, p,p’-DDE, and o,p’-DDT, the primary constituents of technical DDT), we measured methylation in 30 genes important to breast cancer.

The removal of apoptotic cells prevents them from undergoing secondary necrosis and releasing their inflammation-inducing intracellular contents. Efferocytosis also limits tissue damage by increasing immunosuppressive cytokines and leukocytes and maintains tissue homeostasis by promoting tolerance to antigens derived from apoptotic cells. Thus, tumor cell efferocytosis following cytotoxic cancer treatment could impart tolerance to tumor cells evading treatment-induced apoptosis with deleterious consequences in tumor residual disease. We report here that efferocytosis cleared apoptotic tumor cells in residual disease of lapatinib-treated HER2 þ mammary tumors in MMTV-Neu mice, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and regulatory T cells (Treg). Blockade of efferocytosis induced secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, but failed to prevent increased tumor MDSCs, Treg, and immunosuppressive cytokines. We found that efferocytosis stimulated expression of IFN-g, which stimulated the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxegenase (IDO) 1, an immune regulator known for driving maternal-fetal antigen tolerance. Combined inhibition of efferocytosis and IDO1 in tumor residual disease decreased apoptotic cell- and necrotic cell-induced immunosuppressive phenotypes, blocked tumor metastasis, and caused tumor regression in 60% of MMTV-Neu mice. This suggests that apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells, via efferocytosis and IDO1, respectively, promote tumor 'homeostasis' and progression. Significance: These findings show in a model of HER2 þ breast cancer that necrosis secondary to impaired efferocytosis activates IDO1 to drive immunosuppression and tumor progression. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059480272

Methods: Data for 979 breast, lung, and colorectal cancer patients admitted to a large, urban hospital for the year 2010 were extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between relevant independent variables that were able to be captured from the EMR in discrete fields, emergency room (ER) utilization, and hospitalizations among members of the cohort. Spearman correlation coefficients to test the correlations between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and opioid prescriptions and healthcare utilization were also calculated. Results: Of the 979 patients, 22% were 65 years and older, 43% were non-Hispanic black, 42% had Medicare, and 56% had colorectal cancer. Patient and clinical characteristics that were associated with increased ER utilization, included Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio; AOR: 2.21, 95% confidence interval; CI: 1.52-3.21), non-Hispanic black race (AOR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.43-2.82), and referral to palliative care (AOR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.36-3.41). Referral to palliative care (AOR: 3.84, 95% CI: 1.47-10.0), low albumin (AOR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.20-4.89), and presence of metastases (AOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.29-3.06) were associated with greater odds of hospitalization. Number of opioids prescribed strongly correlated with number of hospitalizations (ρ correlation = 0.74). Only 10.6% of patients had been referred to outpatient palliative care during the study period. Conclusions: Some patient and clinical characteristics associated with increased ER visits and hospitalizations in this cohort include race/ethnicity, palliative care referral, markers of advanced disease, and number opioids prescribed.

In this study, we investigated whether selonsertib could reverse MDR-mediated by ABC transporters, including ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1 and ABCC10. The results showed that selonsertib significantly reversed ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR, but not MDR-mediated by ABCC1 or ABCC10. Mechanism studies indicated that the reversal effect of selonsertib was related to the attenuation of the efflux activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters, without the protein level decrease or change in the subcellular localization of ABCB1 or ABCG2. Selonsertib stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and in silico docking study showed selonsertib could interact with the substrate-binding sites of both ABCB1 and ABCG2.

To monitor progress in reducing these inequalities, every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths for blacks in the United States and the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, survival, screening, and risk factors using data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, approximately 202,260 new cases of cancer and 73,030 cancer deaths are expected to occur among blacks in the United States. During 2006 through 2015, the overall cancer incidence rate decreased faster in black men than in white men (2.4% vs 1.7% per year), largely due to the more rapid decline in lung cancer. In contrast, the overall cancer incidence rate was stable in black women (compared with a slight increase in white women), reflecting increasing rates for cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and pancreas juxtaposed with declining trends for cancers of the lung and colorectum. Overall cancer death rates declined faster in blacks than whites among both males (2.6% vs 1.6% per year) and females (1.5% vs 1.3% per year), largely driven by greater declines for cancers of the lung, colorectum, and prostate. Consequently, the excess risk of overall cancer death in blacks compared with whites dropped from 47% in 1990 to 19% in 2016 in men and from 19% in 1990 to 13% in 2016 in women. Moreover, the black-white cancer disparity has been nearly eliminated in men <50 years and women ≥70 years. Twenty-five years of continuous declines in the cancer death rate among black individuals translates to more than 462,000 fewer cancer deaths. Continued progress in reducing disparities will require expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment for all Americans. © 2019 American Cancer Society","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061579587

These controlled conditions may not be representative of the range of imaging conditions implemented clinically. We aim to develop a two-stage method of radiomic texture analysis that incorporates the reproducibility of individual texture features across imaging conditions to guide the development of texture signatures which are robust across mammography unit vendors. Methods: Full-field digital mammograms were retrospectively collected for women who underwent screening mammography on both a Hologic Lorad Selenia and GE Senographe 2000D system. Radiomic features were calculated on manually placed regions of interest in each image. In stage one (robustness assessment), we identified a set of nonredundant features that were reproducible across the two different vendors. This was achieved through hierarchical clustering and application of robustness metrics. In stage two (classification evaluation), we performed stepwise feature selection and leave-one-out quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to construct radiomic signatures. We refer to this two-state method as robustness assessment, classification evaluation (RACE). These radiomic signatures were used to classify the risk of breast cancer through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, using the area under the ROC curve as a figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between women with and without high-risk factors present. Generalizability was investigated by comparing the classification performance of a feature set on the images from which they were selected (intravendor) to the classification performance on images from the vendor on which it was not selected (intervendor). Intervendor and intravendor performances were also compared to the performance obtained by implementing ComBat, a feature-level harmonization method and to the performance by implementing ComBat followed by RACE. Results: Generalizability, defined as the difference between intervendor and intravendor classification performance, was shown to monotonically decrease as the number of clusters used in stage one increased (Mann–Kendall P < 0.001). Intravendor performance was not shown to be statistically different from ComBat harmonization while intervendor performance was significantly higher than ComBat. No significant difference was observed between either of the single methods and the use of ComBat followed by RACE. Conclusions: A two-stage method for robust radiomic signature construction is proposed and demonstrated in the task of breast cancer risk assessment. The proposed method was used to assess generalizability of radiomic texture signatures at varying levels of feature robustness criteria. The results suggest that generalizability of feature sets monotonically decreases as reproducibility of features decreases. This trend suggests that considerations of feature robustness in feature selection methodology could improve classifier generalizability in multifarious full-field digital mammography datasets collected on various vendor units. Additionally, harmonization methods such as ComBat may hold utility in classification schemes and should continue to be investigated. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062783356

Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a screener in community-based oncology clinics. Materials and Methods: Eligible patients were from two rural, underserved community-based cancer clinics; within 12 months of a cancer diagnosis (breast, lung, colorectal, pancreas, esophageal); aged ≥60 years; and not exclusively pursuing palliative care. We used a previously validated tool that was embedded in the electronic health record (EHR). Patient-reported responses identified memory impairment, depressive symptoms, deficits in activities of daily living, poor nutrition, and polypharmacy. At the discretion of the oncologist, responses prompted service referrals. From the EHR, we extracted information about referrals and completion of planned therapy. We present descriptive statistics. Results: Enrolled patients (n = 44) had a mean age of 71.5 years (SD = 6.9). Most were non-white (61%), women (66%), with government-sponsored health insurance (80%). The most commonly identified geriatric syndromes: polypharmacy (89%), reduced quality of life (39%), and poor nutrition (39%). The screener triggered a referral in 98% of patients. Generated referrals were for depressive symptoms (52% needed, 39% received), nutrition (43% needed, 37% received), and polypharmacy (89% needed, 26% received). Patients were referred to social work (56%), nutrition (44%), and pharmacy (25%). Many patients completed planned radiation therapy (100%), surgery (70%), and chemotherapy (60%).

However, normal cells usually have to progress through a precancerous lesion state before becoming a full-blown tumor. Precancerous early lesions are heterogeneous, and the cell subset that is the primary source of the eventual tumor remains largely unknown. By using mouse models that are tailored to address this question, we identified a keratin 6a-expressing precancerous stem cell (PcSC) subset and a more differentiated whey acidic protein-positive (WAPþ) cell subset in mammary precancerous lesions initiated by the Wnt1 oncogene. Both cell subsets rapidly progressed to cancer upon introduction of constitutively active versions of either HRAS or BRAF. However, the resulting tumors were dramatically different in protein profiles and histopathology: keratin 6aþ precancerous cells gave rise to adenocarcinoma, whereas WAPþ cells yielded metaplastic carcinoma with severe squamous differentiation and more robust activation of MEK/ERK signaling. Therefore, both stem and non-stem cells in mammary precancerous lesions can contribute to the eventual cancers, but their differentiation status determines the resulting cancer phenotype. This work identifies a previously unknown player in cancer heterogeneity and suggests that cancer prevention should target precancerous cells broadly and not be limited to PcSC.

Further, patient satisfaction is a determinant of healthcare organizations' institutional performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between patient satisfaction with care and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among Medicare recipients with common cancers types (breast, prostate, or lung cancer). Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of survey data from 637 Medicare beneficiaries (≥65 years) with breast (n = 304), lung (n = 158), or prostate cancer (n = 175) in twelve hospitals in the Southeastern United States. Participants responded eighteen satisfaction questions across five domains. HRQoL was measured with the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores of the SF-12.v2 instrument. Results: SF-12 scores were positively associated with satisfaction domain scores. The magnitude of these associations was small with covariate-adjusted effect sizes r ranging from 0.05 to 0.12. Satisfaction scores were highest within the Quality of Care domain and lowest within the Patient Engagement domain. Conclusions: Patient satisfaction domains had only modest association with HRQoL, indicating that these constructs should not be assumed to correlate. Satisfaction domains, including how patients access care, coordinate care, and engage within the healthcare system, were identified as potential areas for improvement. Patient satisfaction assessment across age groups may inform oncology care providers on ways in which their patients perceive the quality of care received, which ultimately affect healthcare organizations' accreditation, ranking, and reimbursement. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062389888

To address the possible roles of PRMT overexpression in mammary gland tumorigenesis, we generated Cre-activated PRMT1, CARM1, and PRMT6 overexpression mouse models. These three enzymes are the primary type I PRMTs and are responsible for the majority of the asymmetric arginine methylation deposited in the cells. Using either a keratin 5-Cre recombinase (K5-Cre) cross or an MMTV-NIC mouse, we investigated the impact of PRMT overexpression alone or in the context of a HER2-driven model of breast cancer, respectively. The overexpression of all three PRMTs induced hyper-branching of the mammary glands and increased Ki-67 staining. When combined with the MMTV-NIC model, these in vivo experiments provided the first genetic evidence implicating elevated levels of these three PRMTs in mammary gland tumorigenesis, albeit with variable degrees of tumor promotion and latency. In addition, these mouse models provided valuable tools for exploring the biological roles and molecular mechanisms of PRMT overexpression in the mammary gland. For example, transcriptome analysis of purified mammary epithelial cells isolated from bigenic NIC-PRMT1 Tg and NIC-PRMT6 Tg mice revealed a deregulated PI3K–AKT pathway. In the future, these PRMT Tg lines can be leveraged to investigate the roles of arginine methylation in other tissues and tumor model systems using different tissue-specific Cre crosses, and they can also be used for testing the in vivo efficacy of small molecule inhibitors that target these PRMT.

Objective: The objectives of this study were to describe opioid use, including reasons for use and overuse and underuse behavior; characterize opioid stigma; and identify potentially maladaptive stigma-related behaviors. Methods: Participants were 125 adults undergoing active cancer treatment seen at the Moffitt Supportive Care Medicine Clinic. Patients completed a brief, anonymous questionnaire evaluating opioid use, opioid stigma, and stigma-related behaviors. Results: Patients were primarily women (65%) aged 45-64 years (49%), most commonly diagnosed with breast (23%) and hematologic (15%) cancer. Among patients who reported opioid use (n = 109), the most common reason for use was pain relief (94%), followed by improved sleep (25%).

Methods: We examined whether rural and urban participants differed in their response to the RENEW intervention (e.g., physical functioning, quality-of-life, intakes of fruits and vegetables (F&V) and saturated fat, body mass index(BMI), physical activity, and adverse events). Results: Rural versus urban survivors report significantly more favorable mean (SE) changes in physical functioning [− 0.66 (1.47) v − 1.71 (1.00)], physical health [+ 0.14 (0.71) v − 0.74 (0.50)], and fewer adverse events [1.58 (0.08) v 1.64 (0.06)]. Rural versus urban survivors reported smaller increases in F&Vs [+ 1.47 (0.23) v + 1.56(0.16); p = 0.018], and lower percentages achieved goal behavior for endurance exercise and intakes of F&Vs and saturated fat. Conclusions: The RENEW intervention reduced declines in physical health and functioning among RCS to a significantly greater extent than for urban cancer survivors. All survivors significantly improved intakes of F&V and saturated fat, and endurance exercise; however, lower percentages of rural versus urban survivors met goal suggesting that more intensive interventions may be needed for RCS. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061697321

Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of healthy behaviors and sex-specific cancer screening among persons living with HIV, by sex and time since HIV diagnosis. Methods: We included 517 persons living with HIV from the Florida Cohort. Data were obtained from the baseline and follow-up questionnaires, electronic medical records, and Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System. The prevalence of self-reported, age-appropriate cancer screening (anal, colorectal, prostate, breast, and cervical), and healthy behaviors (sustaining healthy body weight, refraining from smoking and alcohol and engaging in physical activity) was compared by sex and years since HIV diagnosis (≤ 13 vs. > 13 years). Results: In the analyses by sex, females were more likely to be obese than males (56.5% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.0001). Distribution of healthy behaviors did not differ by time since diagnosis among males and females. In the analysis of age-appropriate screening among males, 64.8% never had an anal Pap-smear, 36.2% never had a colonoscopy, and 38.9% never had prostate cancer screening. In the analysis of age-appropriate screening among females, 50.0% never had an anal Pap-smear, 46.5% never had a colonoscopy, 7.9% never had a cervical Pap-smear, and 12.7% never had a mammogram. The difference in anal Pap-smear by sex was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Among males, the age-adjusted prevalence of never having a colonoscopy was higher in those who had HIV for ≤ 13 years (50.8% vs. 30.6%, p = 0.03). Conclusion: The prevalence of selected healthy behaviors and cancer screening differed by sex and/or years since HIV diagnosis suggesting a need for tailored cancer prevention efforts among persons living with HIV via long-term sex-specific interventions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061326477

Accordingly, our understanding of the role structure plays in care coordination is limited. Purpose: In this article, we explore service line structure, with an aim of advancing our understanding of the role service line structure plays in producing coordinated, patient-centered care. We do so by giving special attention to the cognitive roots of patient-centeredness. Methodology/Approach: Our exploratory study relied on comparative case studies of the breast cancer service lines in three health systems. Nonprobability discriminative snowball sampling was used to identify the final sample of key informants. We employed a grounded approach to analyzing and interpreting the data. Results: We found substantial variation across the three service lines in terms of their structure. We also found corresponding variation across the three case sites in terms of where informant attention was primarily focused in the process of coordinating care. Drawing on the attention-based view of the firm, our results draw a clear connection between structural characteristics and the dominant focus of attention (operational tactics, provider roles and relationships, or patient needs and engagement) in health care service lines. Conclusion: Our exploratory results suggest that service line structures influence attention in two ways: (a) by regulating the type and intensity of the problems facing service line participants and (b) by encouraging (or discouraging) a shared purpose around patient needs. Practice Implications: Patient-centered attention - a precursor to coordinated, patient-centered care - depends on the internal choices organizations make around service line structure. Moreover, a key task for organizational and service line leaders is to structure service lines to create a context that minimizes distractions and enables care providers to focus their attention on the needs of their patients. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: Trastuzumab was conjugated with SCN-Bn-NOTA and radiolabeled with 64 Cu. Serum stability and immunoreactivity of 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab were tested. Small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in a HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft model (BT-474). The internal dosimetry for experimental animals was determined using the image-based approach with the Monte Carlo N-particle code. Results: 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was prepared with high radiolabeling yield and radiochemical purity (.98%) and showed high stability in serum and good immunoreactivity. Uptake of 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was highest at 48 h after injection as determined by PET imaging and biodistribution results in BT-474 tumors. The blood radioactivity concentrations of 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab decreased biexponentially with time in both mice with and mice without BT-474 tumor xenografts. The calculated absorbed dose of 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was 0.048 mGy/MBq for the heart, 0.079 mGy/MBq for the liver, and 0.047 mGy/MBq for the spleen. Conclusion: 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was effectively targeted to the HER2-expressing tumor in vitro and in vivo, and it exhibited a relatively low absorbed dose due to a short residence time. Therefore, 64 Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab could be applied to select the right patients and right timing for HER2 therapy, to monitor the treatment response after HER2-targeted therapy, and to detect distal or metastatic spread.

Methods: Tumor EP distributions were inferred from a reference area external to the tumor, as well as internal EP spatial variations derived from a plurality of relative transmit B 1 measurements at 7T. Edge sparsity constraint was enforced to enhance numerical stability. Phantom experiments were performed to determine the imaging accuracy and sensitivity for structures of various EP values, as well as geometrical sizes down to 1.5 mm. Numerical simulation of a realistic rodent model was used to quantify the algorithm performance in the presence of noise. Eleven athymic rats with human breast cancer xenograft were imaged in vivo, and representative pathological samples were acquired for comparison. Results: Reconstructed EPs of the phantoms correspond well to the ground truth acquired from dielectric probe measurements, with the smallest structure reliably detectable being 3 mm. EPs heterogeneity inside a tumor is successfully retrieved in both simulated and experimental cases. In vivo tumor imaging results demonstrate similar local features and spatial patterns to anatomical MRI and pathological slides. The imaged conductivity of necrotic tissue is higher than that of viable tissues, which agrees with our expectation. Conclusion: BIEPT enables robust detection of tumor EPs heterogeneity with high accuracy and sensitivity to small structures. The retrieved quantitative EPs reflect tumor pathological features (e.g., necrosis). These results provide strong rationale to further expand BIEPT studies toward pathological conditions where EPs may yield valuable, non-invasive biomarkers. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85053542485

Exercise interventions using digital activity trackers (E-DATs) may improve exercise adherence, but data are limited for patients with cancer. We conducted a systematic review examining the feasibility of E-DATs in cancer survivors and effects on activity level, body composition, objective fitness outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-reported symptoms, and biomarkers. Methods: We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of E-DATs in adult cancer survivors published in English between January 1, 2008, and July 27, 2017. Two authors independently reviewed article titles (n=160), removed duplicates (n=50), and reviewed the remaining 110 articles for eligibility. Results: A total of 12 RCTs met eligibility criteria, including 1,450 patients (mean age, 50–70 years) with the following cancers: breast (n=5), colon or breast (n=2), prostate (n=1), acute leukemia (n=1), or others (n=3). Duration of E-DATs ranged from 4 to 24 weeks, and the follow-up period ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with retention rates of 54% to 95%. The technology component of E-DATs included pedometers (n=8); pedometers with smartphone application (n=1), Wii Fit (n=1), heart rate monitor (n=1); and a wireless sensor with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer (n=1). Adherence by at least one measure to E-DATs was >70% in 8 of 8 RCTs. Compared with controls, E-DATs significantly improved patients’ step count in 3 of 5 RCTs, activity level in 6 of 9 RCTs, and HRQoL in 7 of 9 RCTs (all P≤.05), with no significant changes in biomarkers (eg, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, C-reactive protein, c-peptide, lipid panel) in 3 RCTs. Duration of E-DAT was not significantly correlated with adherence or study retention. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that E-DATs are feasible to implement in cancer survivors.

In Rwanda, general practitioners (GPs) at district hospitals (DHs) play key roles in diagnosing, initiating management, and referring suspected patients with cancer. We sought to ascertain educational and resource needs of GPs to provide a blueprint that can inform future early cancer diagnosis capacity-building efforts. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey study to GPs practicing in 42 Rwandan DHs to assess gaps in cancer-focused knowledge, skills, and resources, as well as delays in the referral process. Responses were aggregated and descriptive analysis was performed to identify trends. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 76% (73 of 96 GPs). Most responders were 25 to 29 years of age (n = 64 [88%]) and 100% had been practicing between 3 and 12 months. Significant gaps in cancer knowledge and physical exam skills were identified-88% of respondents were comfortable performing breast exams, but less than 10 (15%) GPs reported confidence in performing pelvic exams. The main educational resource requested by responders (n = 59 [81%]) was algorithms to guide clinical decision-making. Gaps in resource availability were identified, with only 39% of responders reporting breast ultrasound availability and 5.8% reporting core needle biopsy availability in DHs. Radiology and pathology resources were limited, with 52 (71%) reporting no availability of pathology services at the DH level. CONCLUSION: The current study reveals significant basic oncologic educational and resource gaps in Rwanda, such as physical examination skills and diagnostic tools. Capacity building for GPs in low- and middle-income countries should be a core component of national cancer control plans to improve accurate and timely diagnosis of cancer. Continuing professional development activities should address and focus on context-specific educational gaps, resource availability, and referral practice guidelines.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060383476

Methods: Couples were approached while waiting for an integrative oncology service. Fifty patients and their partners completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS-FS; twelve symptoms, scores 0–10, 10 worst possible) and a Global Health measure (PROMIS10). Patient and partner each also completed the ESAS-FS as it related to their perception of the other’s symptoms. ESAS distress subscales analyzed included Global (GDS), Psychosocial (PSS), and Physical (PHS). Analyses included paired t tests to examine all measures. Results: Fifty-eight percent of patients were female with most common cancer diagnoses of breast (22%), gastrointestinal (16%), and thoracic/H&N (16%). For ESAS-FS self-ratings, patients had significantly higher physical distress than partners, with a no significant difference in psychosocial distress. For PROMIS10 self-ratings, patients reported significantly lower global health and physical health, (p’s < 0.001); no differences were found for mental health between patients and caregivers. Patient rating of partner physical distress (PHS, p = 0.01) was significantly higher than partner self-rating, with no significant difference observed in ratings for psychosocial distress. Partner rating of patient psychosocial distress (PSS, p < 0.001) and physical distress (PHS, p = 0.001) was significantly higher than that of patient self-rating.

Yet, little is known about the current cancer experience in one of the largest Native American tribe, Navajo. A qualitative study of among Navajo cancer survivors, in which focus groups and individual interviews included questions related to perceptions of cancer causes, prevention, and treatment, allowed us to evaluate several aspects of the cancer experience from the Navajo perspective. An experienced, bilingual facilitator led the discussions using a standardized guide. Discussions were audio-recorded, documented by field notes, translated, as needed, and transcribed. NVivo software was used to summarize major themes according to the PEN-3 and health belief models. Navajo cancer survivors (N = 32) were both males (n = 13) and females (n = 19) that had been previously diagnosed with a variety of cancers: colorectal, breast, ovarian, cervical, esophageal, gall bladder, stomach, prostate, kidney, and hematologic. Many survivors had accurate knowledge of risk factors for cancer. Barriers to screening and clinical care included language, expense, geography, fear, lack of information, skepticism related to Western medicine, and treatment side effects. While some survivors experienced familial support, others were isolated from the family and community due to the perspective of cancer as a contagion. However, resilience, hope, trust in select community organizations, a desire to restore balance, and to support younger generations were positive attributes expressed regarding the treatment and recovery process. These evaluations need to be replicated across a larger cross-section of the Native cancer survivor community. © 2019, American Association for Cancer Education.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061501162

Although the incidence is anticipated to rise, contemporary data regarding predictors of outcomes are few. We performed a retrospective analysis to identify RAS prognostic factors and subset analyses for radiation-associated angiosarcoma arising after treatment for breast cancer (RAAB) and other RAS subtypes (other-RAS). Methods and Materials: Patients with localized RAS evaluated at an institutional multidisciplinary sarcoma clinic were identified. Clinical and histologic review was performed, and outcomes were assessed to identify prognostic features. A subset of cases underwent molecular analysis by next-generation sequencing. Results: Among 176 patients, histologic subtypes of RAS included angiosarcoma (41%), undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma (40%), leiomyosarcoma (8%), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (6%), and osteosarcoma (2%). Sixty-seven patients (38%) had RAAB, and 109 (62%) had other-RAS. RAAB had significantly shorter latency from time of initial radiation compared with other-RAS (8 vs. 15 years; P <.001). Treatment approaches included surgery (91%), chemotherapy (44%), and radiation therapy (27%). Median follow-up was 3.2 years; 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74%. On multivariate analysis, positive margins (P <.0001), deep tumor location (intrathoracic/intra-abdominal, P =.002), and high grade (P <.0001) were associated with worse OS. In particular, 3-year OS with negative versus positive margins was 90% versus 66%. Patients with RAAB versus other-RAS showed a trend for higher 3-year OS (84% vs 68%; P =.09), significantly higher 3-year metastasis-free survival (82% vs 67%; P =.001), but similar 3-year local recurrence-free survival (54% vs 61%; P =.28). Next-generation sequencing identified overall low tumor mutational burden, recurrent MYC amplification in RAAB, and few clinically actionable mutations. Conclusions: Margin negative excision, superficial tumor location, and low tumor grade are determinants of improved OS for RAS, suggesting that complete surgical excision, when possible, is an optimal component of treatment. RAAB is a clinicopathologically distinct type of RAS with shorter latency from initial RT, different recurrence patterns, and when aggressively managed has potentially better outcomes compared with other-RAS. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062242109

In advanced non-small cell lung cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) have become second-line therapy and have revolutionized the management in selective cases conferring better overall response rates and progression free survival. Methods: We present a case series and review of literature emphasizing this immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer who were treated with Nivolumab as a second line therapeutic option. Results: PD-1 inhibitors such as, Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, have shown a stable regression of various malignancies, such as metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We describe 2 cases of such immune related adverse effects associated with immune check point inhibitors with recovery in one of the patients. Steroid therapy has been the cornerstone for treatment for such immune related adverse effects. Importance has also been laid on the typical radiographic patterns of pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease associated with immunotherapy.

With millions of women presenting for mammography every year, breast imaging centers may represent ideal venues to identify women at risk for IPV and refer them to appropriate support services. Our purpose was to evaluate implementation of a novel IPV screening and referral system for women presenting for mammography. Methods: A question was added to intake questionnaire (“Do you feel safe in your home?”) for adult women presenting for screening or diagnostic mammography from 2016 to 2017 at our hospital outpatient breast imaging sites. The proportion of women presenting for screening or diagnostic mammogram who felt unsafe was calculated. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare baseline characteristics of women who stated that they felt unsafe at home versus women who did not state that they felt unsafe at home. Results: In all, 99,029 examinations were performed (68,158 unique patients). Of these patients, 71 stated that they felt unsafe at home (71 of 68,158, 0.1%). Women presenting for their first mammogram were more likely to report feeling unsafe at home (odds ratio 3.03, 95% confidence interval 1.31-7.06, P =.01). No differences were found in age (P =.148), ethnicity (P =.271), gravida (P =.676), parity (P =.752), age at menarche (P =.775), and history of breast cancer (P =.726).

Psychiatric care at cancer diagnosis may improve care delivery, yet models for integrating psychiatry and cancer care are lacking. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a person-centered collaborative care trial for SMI and cancer. Subjects, Materials, and Methods: We developed the Bridge intervention for patients with SMI (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe major depression) and cancer. Bridge includes proactive identification of SMI, person-centered care from a psychiatrist and case manager, and collaboration with oncology. We conducted a 12-week, single-group trial in patients with SMI and a new breast, gastrointestinal, lung, or head/neck cancer. We assessed the feasibility of patient identification, enrollment and study completion; evaluated acceptability and perceived benefit with exit interviews with patients, caregivers, and oncology clinicians; and examined change in psychiatric symptoms with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: From November 2015 to April 2016, 30/33 eligible patients (90.9%) enrolled, and 25/29 (86.2%) completed assessments at all timepoints, meeting feasibility criteria. Of 24 patients, 23 (95.8%) found meeting with the psychiatrist helpful; 16/19 caregivers (84.2%) shared that Bridge addressed key caregiving challenges. Oncology clinicians evaluated Bridge as “very” or “most” useful for 94.3% of patients. Exit interviews with all participant groups suggested that Bridge fostered patient-clinician trust, increased access to psychiatric treatment, and enabled patients to initiate and complete cancer treatment. Psychiatric symptoms on the BPRS improved from baseline to 12 weeks. Conclusion: Bridge is a feasible and acceptable care delivery model for patients with SMI, their caregivers, and oncology clinicians. Randomized trials are warranted to assess the efficacy of improving cancer outcomes in this underserved population. Implications for Practice: Serious mental illness affects 13 million U.S. adults who experience increased cancer mortality. To improve outcomes, new models of integrated oncology and mental health care are urgently needed. This study found that it was feasible to identify, enroll, and retain patients with serious mental illness and a new cancer in a trial of integrated mental health and cancer care (Bridge). Patients, caregivers, and oncologists reported that Bridge facilitated the initiation and completion of cancer care. Randomized trials are warranted to investigate the impact on cancer outcomes.

Genome-wide association studies have identified over 100 genetic variants associated with modified breast and/or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Risk models generated based on these variants have shown that these genetic modifiers strongly influence absolute risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer in BRCA mutation carriers. There is a lack of understanding, however, about the clinical applicability and utility of these risk models. To investigate this gap, we collected survey data from 274 cancer genetic counselors (GCs) through the National Society of Genetic Counselors Cancer Special Interest Group. Questions assessed perceptions of usefulness and intentions of genetic counselors to use these refined risk models in clinical care based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We found that GCs’ reactions to the estimates were largely positive, though they thought the possibility of changing management based on results was unlikely. Additionally, we found that more experienced GCs were more likely to consider refined risk estimates in clinic.

Although serious, most of these diagnoses are not terminal. Inherited risk for prostate cancer is associated with aggressive disease and poorer outcomes, indicating a critical need for increased genetic screening to identify disease-causing variants that can pinpoint individuals at increased risk for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Objective: To identify positive (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and increased risk) germline variants in a large prostate cancer cohort and to evaluate the usefulness of current practice guidelines in recognizing individuals at increased risk for prostate cancer who would benefit from diagnostic genetic testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of data from 3607 men with a personal history of prostate cancer who underwent germline genetic testing between 2013 and 2018 and were unselected for family history, stage of disease, or age at diagnosis. Referral-based testing was performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments/College of American Pathologists-certified diagnostic laboratory. All analysis took place between February 2017 and August 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The frequency and distribution of positive germline variants, and the percentage of individuals with prostate cancer who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for germline genetic testing. Results: Of 3607 men (mean [SD] age at testing, 67 [9.51] years; mean age at diagnosis, 60 [9.05] years) with a personal diagnosis of prostate cancer who were referred for genetic testing, 620 (17.2%) had positive germline variants, of which only 30.7% were variants in BRCA1/2. Positive variants in HOXB13, a gene associated only with prostate cancer risk, were identified in 30 patients (4.5%). DNA mismatch repair variants with substantial known therapeutic implications were detected in 1.74% of variants in the total population tested. Examination of self-reported family histories indicated that 229 individuals (37%) with positive variants in this cohort would not have been approved for genetic testing using the NCCN genetic/familial breast and ovarian guidelines for patients with prostate cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: Current NCCN guidelines and Gleason scores cannot reliably stratify patients with prostate cancer for the presence or absence of pathogenic germline variants. Most positive genetic test results identified in this study have important management implications for patients and their families, which underscores the need to revisit current guidelines. © 2019 American Medical Association.

Primary management options include observation or surgical excision, but little is known about long-term outcomes after fibroadenoma excision in adolescents. In the present study, we reviewed the medical records of females aged 13-35 years who underwent fibroadenoma excision at our institution from 1986 through 2010. Patients were included if they had excision of at least 1 fibroadenoma (confirmed by histopathology) smaller than 5 cm in maximal diameter. We collected information pertaining to clinical presentation, management, and outcomes. In addition, an investigator-designed long-term outcome survey was sent to 138 eligible participants to assess patient satisfaction, as well as the recurrence of fibroadenoma, and the need or desire for further surgical intervention. Most patients (126 of 138) underwent 1 operation for fibroadenoma excision. Three women underwent immediate breast reconstruction at fibroadenoma excision. Fifty-seven patients completed the investigator-designed survey (response rate, 41.3%) with a median follow-up time of 13.5 (range, 2.0-26.7) years. Nine of 55 patients (16.4%) reported postoperative breast asymmetry and the desire to pursue reconstructive surgery. Three survey responders reported breast pain. Fourteen of 56 women (25.0%) reported the diagnosis of 1 or more additional fibroadenomas after the initial excision; another 7 reported recurrence of the mass at the site of excision. Most survey participants were satisfied with the aesthetic outcome of their fibroadenoma excision; however, a small proportion believed that they would benefit from reconstructive breast surgery. The recurrence and development of additional fibroadenomas should be addressed by providers during counseling for treatment options and postoperative follow-up. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85056672129

To date, the most common factors used to estimate a man’s risk of developing PCa are age, race, and family history. Despite recent advances in its utility in multiple malignancies (e.g., breast and colon cancer), genetic testing is still relatively underutilized in PCa. CONTENT: Multiple highly penetrant genes (HPGs) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been show to increase a patient’s risk of developing PCa. Mutations in the former, like DNA damage repair genes, can confer a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of developing PCa and can increase the risk of aggressive disease. Similarly, PCa-risk SNPs can be used to create risk scores (e.g., genetic or polygenic risk scores) that can be used to further stratify an individual’s disease susceptibility. Specifically, these genetic risk scores can provide more specific estimates of a man’s lifetime risk ranging up to 6-fold higher risk of PCa. SUMMARY: It is becoming increasingly evident that in addition to the standard family history and race information, it is necessary to obtain genetic testing (including an assessment of HPG mutation status and genetic risk score) to provide a full risk assessment. The additional information derived thereby will improve current practices in PCa screening by risk-stratifying patients before initial prostate-specific antigen testing, determining a patient’s frequency of visits, and even help identify potentially at-risk family members. © 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059493393

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if calcifications recalled from screening mammography are more likely to result in biopsy recommendations than other findings. Methods: IRB-approved electronic medical record search was performed to obtain a random sample of screening mammograms assigned BI-RADS 0 assessment during 2014–2015. Primary reason for recall was classified as mass, asymmetry, focal asymmetry, calcifications, or distortion. Primary outcome was biopsy performed after diagnostic work-up. Secondary outcome was proportion of biopsies performed that were positive for cancer, positive predictive value 3 (PPV3). Logistic regression was used to compare reasons for recall (calcifications vs other findings) with biopsy recommendation proportions. Results: Random database sampling yielded 402 screening examinations with BI-RADS 0 assessments with 449 total findings. Reasons for recall included calcifications (14.0%, 63/449), masses (15.8%, 71/449), asymmetries (50.8%, 228/449), focal asymmetries (14.3%, 64/449) and architectural distortions (5.1%, 23/449). Overall, 21.6% of recalls led to image-guided biopsy (87/402). Recalls for calcifications were more likely to result in biopsy compared with other types of findings (Adjusted OR 8.56, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.0, p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in PPV3 proportions between calcification and non-calcification findings (p = 0.812). Conclusion: Recalls for calcifications are much more likely to undergo biopsy compared with other findings. Increased biopsy rates for calcifications should be considered when recalling a patient from mammography screening in the context of practice specific positive predictive values and cancer detection rates. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85054814402

These debates are reflected in the conflicting recommendations about mammography issued by major professional organizations, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Cancer Society. Previous research has shown that these recommendations garner substantial media attention—and therefore might affect women's screening perceptions and behaviors—but to date analyses of such media coverage have focused on single publicized announcements. Methods: To assess whether media coverage of mammography screening recommendations has evolved, we conducted a content analysis of televised news from four discrete media events from 2009 to 2016, all of which focused on publicized screening recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Cancer Society (N = 364 stories). Results: Media coverage of mammography screening recommendations has featured persistent messages of conflict and/or controversy over time. The evolution of controversy was also reflected in shifts in the relative attention given to mammography screening's risks and benefits, with consistent and, in some cases, heightened attention to screening's risks during more recent media events. Overall, the accuracy of media coverage improved over time. Conclusions: Results underscore the continued prevalence of conflicting and/or controversial information about mammography screening in the public information environment. Cumulative exposure to such messages could influence women's decision making around screening and trust in cancer prevention recommendations. Strategies are needed to better equip all women (and particularly underserved women) to negotiate mammography controversy and weigh the benefits and risks of screening. © 2018 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health","Final",,2-s2.0-85055981543

An alternative, and possibly more powerful approach is to target and reprogram the innate immune system within the tumor microenvironment. To this end, blockade of CD47 has been demonstrated as an attractive approach. Blockade of CD47 inhibits antiphagocytic signals therefore inducing macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells. CD47 blockade also primes antitumor T-cell responses by either activating antigen-presenting cells or inhibiting interactions between CD47 on cancer cells and the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 on T cells. Here, a combination immunotherapy is identified using cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) in situ vaccination and CD47-blocking antibodies. The CPMV in situ vaccine synergizes with CD47 blockade, because CPMV in situ vaccination activates the innate immune system, leading to recruitment and activation of phagocytes. Therefore, the combination therapy targets monocytes and boosts their ability of cancer cell phagocytosis, in turn priming the adaptive immune system leading to a potent antitumor immune response. This work presents a novel strategy to promote macrophage activity to kill tumor cells, and hold promise to enhance T cells targeted immunotherapies by inducing both innate and adaptive arms of immune system. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To determine risk factors for developing MPMs and compare the survival of patients with MPMs to those with single primary melanomas, a prospective, multidisciplinary database of patients with melanoma at a single tertiary care institution was retrospectively reviewed. From 1985 to 2013, 6,963 patients with single primary melanomas and 305 patients with MPMs were identified. Mean follow-up was 8.3 ± 6.3 years for patients with single primary melanomas and 8.8 ± 5.9 years for patients with MPMs. Risk of developing multiple melanomas increased with age at diagnosis of first melanoma (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20 for a 10-year increase in age, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–1.29, P < 0.001), male sex (HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.12–1.84, P = 0.005), and white race (HR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.45–6.51).

These studies, however, tend to ignore clinical characteristics and have not incorporated population-based data regarding the distribution of ODX results across different clinical risk groups. Accordingly, this study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ODX across strata of clinical risk groups using population-based ODX data. Methods: We created state-transition models to calculate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over the lifetime for women with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, HER2-negative, lymph node–negative breast cancer from a US payer perspective. Using the Connecticut Tumor Registry, we classified the 2,245 patients diagnosed in 2011 through 2013 into 3 clinical risk groups according to the PREDICT model, a risk calculator developed by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Within each risk group, we then determined the recurrence score (RS) distributions (<18, 18–30, and ≥31). Other input parameters were derived from the literature. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Approximately 82.5%, 11.9%, and 5.6% of our sample were in the PREDICT low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. When combining these 3 groups, ODX had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,200 per QALY for patients aged 60 years. The ICERs, however, differed across clinical risk groups, ranging from $124,600 per QALY in the low-risk group, to $28,700 per QALY in the intermediate-risk group, to $15,700 per QALY in the high-risk group. Results were sensitive to patient age: the ICER for patients aged 45 to 75 years ranged from $77,100 to $344,600 per QALY in the PREDICT low-risk group, and was lower than $100,000 per QALY in the intermediate- and high-risk groups.

The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of women who were willing to receive extended ET if recommended by their physician and secondarily, to determine what factors were associated with this decision. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study surveyed 131 women with AJCC 7th Edition stages I–III breast cancer who had been taking adjuvant ET for 3–5 years. The survey inquired about the willingness to continue ET, quality of life (FACT-ES), and beliefs about medications (BMQ). Logistic regression was used to test for associations between clinical and disease factors, FACT-ES, BMQ, and the primary outcome. Results: One hundred and twelve (85%) patients reported “moderate” (n = 30, 23%), “quite a bit” (n = 41, 31%), or “extreme” (n = 41, 31%) willingness to pursue extended ET; 19 (14%) patients were “not at all” or were “unlikely” to be willing to take extended ET. On univariate analysis, lower total and social well-being FACT-ES scores, and lower perceived necessity and higher concerns on BMQ were associated with lower willingness to pursue extended ET. On multivariable analysis, greater patient perception of necessity of ET was the only factor associated with willingness to pursue extended ET (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15–1.57, p = 0.0005). Conclusions: Most women who have taken ET for multiple years report being willing to pursue extended ET if recommended.

The objective of this study was to use statistical methods to disaggregate all publicly funded health expenditure by disease and comorbidities in order to answer three research questions: (1) What is health expenditure by disease phase for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in New Zealand? (2) Is the cost of having two NCDs more or less than that expected given the independent costs of each NCD? (3) How is total health spending disaggregated by NCDs across age and by sex? Methods and findings: We used linked data for all adult New Zealanders for publicly funded events, including hospitalisation, outpatient, pharmaceutical, laboratory testing, and primary care from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2014. These data include 18.9 million person-years and $26.4 billion in spending (US$ 2016). We used case definition algorithms to identify if a person had any of six NCDs (cancer, cardiovascular disease [CVD], diabetes, musculoskeletal, neurological, and a chronic lung/liver/kidney [LLK] disease). Indicator variables were used to identify the presence of any of the 15 possible comorbidity pairings of these six NCDs. Regression was used to estimate excess annual health expenditure per person. Cause deletion methods were used to estimate total population expenditure by disease. A majority (59%) of health expenditure was attributable to NCDs. Expenditure due to diseases was generally highest in the year of diagnosis and year of death. A person having two diseases simultaneously generally had greater health expenditure than the expected sum of having the diseases separately, for all 15 comorbidity pairs except the CVD-cancer pair. For example, a 60-64-year-old female with none of the six NCDs had $633 per annum expenditure. If she had both CVD and chronic LLK, additional expenditure for CVD separately was $6,443/$839/$9,225 for the first year of diagnosis/prevalent years/last year of life if dying of CVD; additional expenditure for chronic LLK separately was $6,443/$1,291/$9,051; and the additional comorbidity expenditure of having both CVD and LLK was $2,456 (95% confidence interval [CI] $2,238-$2,674). The pattern was similar for males (e.g., additional comorbidity expenditure for a 60-64-year-old male with CVD and chronic LLK was $2,498 [95% CI $2,264-$2,632]). In addition to this, the excess comorbidity costs for a person with two diseases was greater at younger ages, e.g., excess expenditure for 45-49-year-old males with CVD and chronic LLK was 10 times higher than for 75-79-year-old males and six times higher for females. At the population level, 23.8% of total health expenditure was attributable to higher costs of having one of the 15 comorbidity pairs over and above the six NCDs separately; of the remaining expenditure, CVD accounted for 18.7%, followed by musculoskeletal (16.2%), neurological (14.4%), cancer (14.1%), chronic LLK disease (7.4%), and diabetes (5.5%). Major limitations included incomplete linkage to all costed events (although these were largely non-NCD events) and missing private expenditure. Conclusions: The costs of having two NCDs simultaneously is typically superadditive, and more so for younger adults. Neurological and musculoskeletal diseases contributed the largest health system costs, in accord with burden of disease studies finding that they contribute large morbidity. Just as burden of disease methodology has advanced the understanding of disease burden, there is a need to create disease-based costing studies that facilitate the disaggregation of health budgets at a national level. © 2019 Blakely et al.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85059795770

To identify drugs synthetic lethal with RB1 mutation (RB1 mut ), we tested 36 cell-cycle inhibitors using a cancer cell panel profiling approach optimized to discern cytotoxic from cytostatic effects. Inhibitors of the Aurora kinases AURKA and AURKB showed the strongest RB1 association in this assay. LY3295668, an AURKA inhibitor with over 1,000-fold selectivity versus AURKB, is distinguished by minimal toxicity to bone marrow cells at concentrations active against RB1 mut cancer cells and leads to durable regression of RB1 mut tumor xenografts at exposures that are well tolerated in rodents. Genetic suppression screens identified enforcers of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) as essential for LY3295668 cytotoxicity in RB1-deficient cancers and suggest a model in which a primed SAC creates a unique dependency on AURKA for mitotic exit and survival. Significance: The identification of a synthetic lethal interaction between RB1 and AURKA inhibition, and the discovery of a drug that can be dosed continuously to achieve uninterrupted inhibition of AURKA kinase activity without myelosuppression, suggest a new approach for the treatment of RB1-deficient malignancies, including patients progressing on CDK4/6 inhibitors. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061279355

Materials and methods: Between January 2012 and January 2016, 85 patients underwent 109 SIRT treatments for either primary or secondary hepatic malignancies. There were 59 men and 26 women with a mean age of 62.4 years (range: 39–89 years). Patients’ medical records were retrospectively reviewed for procedural, historical, laboratory and imaging information. The imaging study was considered to have changed patients’ clinical management if it resulted in the addition of a new procedure, canceling of a planned procedure or change in systemic therapy. Results: The one-month post-treatment imaging findings led to management changes in 10 of 109 (9.2%) of treatments. When evaluated by cancer type, 2/61 (3.3%) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatments had management changed while 8/48 (16.7%) non-HCC treatments underwent management change (P = 0.03). This difference was also significant at multivariate analysis (P = 0.03; odds ratio: 0.17 [0.03–082]). Conclusion: Management is rarely changed by one-month post-SIRT imaging in patients with HCC and thus is likely unwarranted. Conversely, in non-HCC patients, one month post-SIRT imaging led to a significant percentage of clinical management changes suggesting that one month imaging in this setting is likely warranted. © 2018 Soci showét showé françaises de radiologie","Final",,2-s2.0-85050864714

Its activity against taxane-resistant xenografts makes it a potential drug candidate against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These properties are linked to the ability of STX140 to act in a multitargeting fashion in vivo as a microtubule disruptor, leading to cell cycle arrest and with both proapoptotic and anti-angiogenic activities. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a well-established biomarker for aggressive cancers, including TNBC.

By predicting the clinical drug response correctly, clinicians are able to understand patient-to-patient differences in drug sensitivity outcomes, which in turn results in lesser time spent and lower cost associated with identifying effective drug candidates. Although technological advances in high-throughput drug screening in cells led to the generation of a substantial amount of relevant data, the analysis of such data would be a challenging task. There is a critical need for advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate accurate predictions of clinical drug response. A major goal of this work is to provide advanced ML tools to data analysts, who would in turn build prediction calculators to be incorporated into intelligent clinical decision support systems. Such innovative tools could be used to enhance patient-care, among other uses. To achieve this goal, we develop new ML techniques, including a transfer learning approach coupled with or without a boosting technique.

We present shallow sparsely-connected autoencoders (SSCAs) and variational autoencoders (SSCVAs) as tools for projecting gene-level data onto gene sets. We tested these approaches on single-cell RNA-Sequencing data from blood cells and on RNA-Sequencing data from breast cancer patients.

In spite of significant progress, the regulation of active Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathways is still poorly understood. In this study, we show that F-box protein 16 (FBXO16) is a putative tumor suppressor. It is a component of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin1-F-box protein) complex, which targets the nuclear β-catenin protein to facilitate proteasomal degradation through the 26S proteasome. FBXO16 interacts physically with the C-terminal domain of β-catenin and promotes its lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination. In addition, it inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by attenuating the level of β-catenin. Therefore, depletion of FBXO16 leads to increased levels of β-catenin, which then promotes cell invasion, tumor growth, and EMT of cancer cells. Furthermore, FBXO16 and β-catenin share an inverse correlation of cellular expression in clinical breast cancer patient samples. In summary, we propose that FBXO16 functions as a putative tumor suppressor by forming an SCF FBXO16 complex that targets nuclear β-catenin in a unique manner for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation to prevent malignancy.

Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) has been shown to play a crucial role in regulation of mitotic entry, progression, and exit. We previously observed, in Xenopus egg extracts, that phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit (PPP1R10/PNUTS) acts as a mitotic regulator by negatively modulating PP1. This study investigates the role of PNUTS in mitotic progression in mammalian cells, and demonstrates that PNUTS expression is elevated in mitosis and depletion partially blocks mitotic entry. Cells that enter mitosis after PNUTS knockdown exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation. Aurora A/B kinase complexes and several kinetochore components are identified as PNUTS-associated proteins. PNUTS depletion suppresses the activation of Aurora A/B kinases, and disrupts the spatiotemporal regulation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). PNUTS dynamically localizes to kinetochores, and is required for the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Finally, PNUTS depletion sensitizes the tumor cell response to Aurora inhibition, suggesting that PNUTS is a potential drug target in combination anticancer therapy. Implications: Delineation of how PNUTS governs the mitotic activation and function of Aurora kinases will improve the understanding of the complex phospho-regu-lation in mitotic progression, and suggest new options to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Aurora inhibitors. 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059502032

We explored the impact and management of pruritus in patients with solid tumors, using patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data from a real-world registry. Methods: From 2006 to 2011, patients seen in the Duke Cancer Institute reported their symptoms via the Patient Care Monitor v2.0, a validated PRO tool that includes a 0–10-point question about pruritus severity. From > 25,000 encounters, 203 patients reported severe pruritus (> 6/10) on at least one visit and 506 total visits were abstracted where patients reported either moderate or severe pruritus (> 3/10). From this cohort, we abstracted demographics, diagnosis, stage, cancer therapy, anti-pruritic therapy, and clinicians’ responses. Results: Mean age was 59.8 (SD 13.3), 134 (66%) were female, 125 (62%) were Caucasian, and 65 (32%) were African American. Breast cancer was the most common tumor (36.5%), followed by lung cancer (23.2%).

It is critical to evaluate the impact of BSO on non-cancer outcomes, including quality of life (QOL), menopausal symptoms and sexual functioning. Methods: BRCA mutation carriers who elected to undergo a BSO completed three questionnaires prior to surgery and then again approximately one and three years following surgery which included: 1) medical history questionnaire, 2) Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Intervention questionnaire and 3) Sexual Activity Questionnaire. The change in quality of life, menopausal symptoms and sexual functioning before and after oophorectomy was determined using a paired t-test and stratified by menopausal status at surgery. Results: We included 140 BRCA mutation carriers with an average follow-up of 3.5 years following BSO. Among 93 women who were premenopausal, oophorectomy was associated with an increase in menopausal symptoms (vasomotor, physical) (P < 0.001) and a decline in sexual functioning (discomfort, pleasure) (P ≤ 0.0001), but had no impact on overall QOL (P = 0.31). HRT mitigated, but did not eliminate the adverse effects. Women who were postmenopausal at surgery (n = 47) experienced an increase in physical symptoms (P = 0.03) and a decline in sexual functioning (discomfort) (P = 0.004) and in overall QOL (P = 0.04). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that 3.5 years after oophorectomy, BRCA mutation carriers experience a significant worsening of menopausal symptoms and a decline in sexual functioning, particularly among those who underwent surgery prior to natural menopause. The use of HRT mitigated some but not all the effects. Overall, women who were premenopausal at surgery did not experience a decline in their QOL. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85055965455

Procedure: Three-dimensional spheroid cultures of primary mammary tumor epithelial cells isolated from freshly excised tumors from a transgenic mouse model of adenocarcinoma (MMTV-PyMT) were imaged by using vital dyes and mitochondrial membrane potential markers. Custom-developed java and python program codes facilitated image processing, numerical computation, and graphical analysis of large datasets generated from the experiments. A panel of cancer drugs (rapamycin, BEZ235, MK2206, and flavopiridol) was tested to determine the degree of drug sensitivity as well as heterogeneity in drug response. Results: A new quantitative metric (growth/toxicity) was developed based on morphometric parameters that were found to track the growth and apoptotic cell populations. Further, this study identified two parameters, namely, skew and kurtosis—which report the spatial heterogeneity in mitochondrial metabolism within the spheroids. The results of this study show that three-dimensional tumor spheroids selectively respond to cancer drugs depending on the specific metabolic pathways (AKT inhibition pathway in the present study), and there exists significant heterogeneity in the untreated tumor spheroids. Drug sensitivity of the spheroids was found to be associated with significant alterations in mitochondrial heterogeneity within the spheroids.

The objectives are to evaluate two steroid-based mouthrinses for preventing/ameliorating mIAS in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated with everolimus. Materials and Methods: This prospective, randomized phase II study enrolled 100 postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive MBC within the US Oncology Network who were initiating therapy with an aromatase inhibitor + everolimus (AIE; 10 mg/day). Patients were randomized to prophylactic therapy with one of two oral rinses (Arm 1: Miracle Mouthwash [MMW] 480 mL recipe: 320 mL oral Benadryl [diphenhydramine; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA], 2 g tetracycline, 80 mg hydrocortisone, 40 mL nystatin suspension, water; or Arm 2: prednisolone [P] 15 mg/5 mL oral solution, 1.8% alcohol). Patients were instructed to swish/expectorate 10 mL of the assigned rinse for 1–2 minutes four times daily starting with day 1 of AIE treatment, for the first 12 weeks. Results: A total of 100 patients received treatment (49 MMW; 51 P). The incidence of stomatitis/oral AEs during the first 12 weeks was 35% (n = 17/49) and 37% (19/51) in the MMW and P arms, respectively. The incidence of grade 2 oral AEs was 14% (7/49) and 12% (6/51) with MMW or P, respectively. There were two grade 3 oral AEs (MMW arm) and no grade 4 events. There was one everolimus dose reduction (MMW) and six dose delays (four MMW, two P) and one dose reduction + delay (MMW) during the first 12 weeks of treatment. No patients stopped steroid mouthwash therapy because of rinse-related toxicity. Conclusion: Prophylactic use of steroid-containing oral rinses can prevent/ameliorate mIAS in patients with MBC treated with AIE. MMW + hydrocortisone is an affordable option, as is dexamethasone oral rinse. Implications for Practice: This prospective phase-II study showed that two steroid-containing mouthrinses substantially reduced incidences of all-grade and grade ≥2 stomatitis and related oral adverse events (AEs), and the number of everolimus dose-delays and/or dose-reduction in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients receiving everolimus treatment plus an aromatase inhibitor. Both oral rinses were well tolerated and demonstrated similar efficacy. Prophylactic use of steroid mouth rinse provides a cost-effective option that substantially decreases the incidence and severity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor-associated stomatitis and related oral AEs as well as the need for dose modification in MBC patients undergoing treatment with an mTOR inhibitor. © AlphaMed Press 2019","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062619457

Focus groups were moderated and recorded by two members of the research team using a semi-structured interview format. The audio recordings were transcribed and uploaded to NViVO 11 for analyses. Four focus groups were conducted with 25 participants. The mean age of participants was 58.4 years (SD = 15.1, range 26.0–76.0). Participants who were identified as patients (84%) reported different malignancy types including breast (56%), gynecologic (16%), skin (6%) oral (6%), and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (6%). Three major themes that emerged around the patient-oncologist relationship, include (1) choosing a physician and health care location, (2) relationship with the physician, health care team, and hospital environment; and (3) patient engagement and decision-making. Subthemes highlighted the importance of the flexible communication behaviors and trustworthiness of the oncologist, and the impact of other health care team members. Patients also reported the desire to be engaged in making treatment-related decisions and to include the caregiver/spouse in all stages of cancer care. Understanding the experience of cancer patients in a relationship with their oncologist in the context of the health care team and health care environment will be an important area of future research to provide optimal, tailored patient-centered cancer care. © 2019, American Association for Cancer Education.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061662841

For gene expression data, network analysis has been shown to be more informative and powerful than individual-gene and geneset-based analysis. Despite promising successes, with the high dimensionality of gene expression data and often low sample sizes, network construction with gene expression data is still often challenged. In recent studies, a prominent trend is to conduct multidimensional profiling, under which data are collected on gene expressions as well as their regulators (copy number variations, methylation, microRNAs, SNPs, etc). With the regulation relationship, regulators contain information on gene expressions and can potentially assist in estimating their characteristics. In this study, we develop an assisted graphical model (AGM) approach, which can effectively use information in regulators to improve the estimation of gene expression graphical structure. The proposed approach has an intuitive formulation and can adaptively accommodate different regulator scenarios. Its consistency properties are rigorously established. Extensive simulations and the analysis of a breast cancer gene expression data set demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the AGM. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85062800750

We aimed to quantify the impact of this variation on doses to critical organs and examine patterns of chest wall recurrence relative to the pectoralis muscle. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively assessed patterns of chest wall recurrence quantified to the recommended CTV borders for women treated between 2005 and 2017. We compared treatment plans for 5 women who were treated with left postmastectomy radiation therapy, with the chest wall contoured using varying dorsal borders for CTV: (1) Anterior pleural surface (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), (2) anterior surface of pectoralis major (European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology), and (3) anterior rib surface (institutional practice). Treatment plans were generated for 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Doses to organs-at-risk were compared using paired-sample t tests. Results: Institutional patterns of chest wall recurrence were 64.7% skin and subcutaneous tissue, 23.5% both anterior to and between the pectoralis muscles, and 11.8% isolated to the tissue between the pectoralis major and minor. No chest wall recurrences were noted deep to pectoralis minor. When comparing the plans generated per the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group versus European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology contouring guidelines, the mean lung V20Gy, heart mean dose, and left anterior descending artery mean dose were 33.5% versus 29.4% (P <.01), 5.2 Gy versus 3.2Gy (P =.02), and 27.3Gy versus 17.8Gy (P =.04), respectively. Conclusions: The recommended variations in the dorsal chest wall CTV border have significant impact on doses to the heart and lungs. Although our study was limited by small numbers, our institutional patterns of recurrence would support a more anterior dorsal border for the chest wall CTV consistent with older literature. © 2018 The Author(s)","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85055418754

Here we show that the arginine methyl transferase protein PRMT5 can complex with FOXP3 transcription factors in Tregs. Mice with conditional knock out (cKO) of PRMT5 expression in Tregs develop severe scurfy-like autoimmunity. In these PRMT5 cKO mice, the spleen has reduced numbers of Tregs, but normal numbers of Tregs are found in the peripheral lymph nodes. These peripheral Tregs that lack PRMT5, however, display a limited suppressive function. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that FOXP3 can be di-methylated at positions R27, R51, and R146. A point mutation of Arginine (R) 51 to Lysine (K) led to defective suppressive functions in human CD4 T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 by DS-437 also reduced human Treg functions and inhibited the methylation of FOXP3. In addition, DS-437 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effects of anti-erbB2/neu monoclonal antibody targeted therapy in Balb/c mice bearing CT26Her2 tumors by inhibiting Treg function and induction of tumor immunity. Controlling PRMT5 activity is a promising strategy for cancer therapy in situations where host immunity against tumors is attenuated in a FOXP3 dependent manner.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85062105221

Pathologic corneal neovascularization is a major cause of blindness worldwide, and treatment options are currently limited. VEGF is one of the critical mediators of corneal neovascularization but current anti-VEGF therapies have produced limited results in the cornea. Thus, additional therapeutic agents are needed to enhance the antiangiogenic arsenal. Our group previously demonstrated epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) involvement in pathologic angiogenesis in multiple cancer models including breast cancer and glioblastoma. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of anti-EMP2 immunotherapy in the prevention of corneal neovascularization. METHODS. An in vivo murine cornea alkali burn model was used to study pathologic neovascularization. A unilateral corneal burn was induced using NaOH, and subconjunctival injection of either anti-EMP2 antibody, control antibody, or sterile saline was performed after corneal burn. Neovascularization was clinically scored at 7 days postalkali burn, and eyes were enucleated for histologic analysis and immunostaining including VEGF, CD31, and CD34 expression. RESULTS. Anti-EMP2 antibody, compared to control antibody or vehicle, significantly reduced neovascularization as measured by clinical score and central cornea thickness, as well as by histologic reduction of neovascularization, decreased CD34 staining, and decreased CD31 staining. Incubation of corneal limbal cells in vitro with anti-EMP2 blocking antibody significantly decreased EMP2 expression, VEGF expression and secretion, and cell migration. CONCLUSIONS. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of EMP2 as a novel target in pathologic corneal neovascularization in an animal model and supports additional investigation into EMP2 antibody blockade as a potential new therapeutic option. © 2019 The Authors.","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85060032789

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrate that glycyrrhizic acid (GA) prevents HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis through gut microbiota. GA reduced HFD-enhanced myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment, pro-metastatic protein S100A8/A9 expression and metastasis burden of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma, accompanied by gut microbiota alteration and colonic macrophage polarization far away the M1-like phenotype. These parameters were greatly decreased by treatment with antibiotics, recolonization of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Clostridium sordellii, and administration of lipopolysaccharide or deoxycholic acid. Macrophage depletion attenuated HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, but failed to further affect the effects of GA. Mechanistically, counteraction of HFD-enhanced gut microbiota dysbiosis by GA inhibited Gr-1 + myeloid cell migration and S100A8/A9 expression through decreasing the proportion of M1-like macrophages and their production of CCL2 and TNF-α in the colons via LPS/HMGB1/NF-κB signaling inactivation. Together, targeting the gut microbiota by GA to modulate colonic macrophages could be a novel strategy for the prevention of HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. © 2019, Society for Mucosal Immunology.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85061474806

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of women with stage I or II uterine carcinosarcoma at our institution between March 1990 and June 2016. All pathology had been reviewed and confirmed by gynecologic pathologists. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to compare clinicopathologic characteristics. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for survival outcomes. Results: 140 patients were identified. Median age was 67 years (range: 36–91). Median follow-up was 39.1 months (2.9–297.4). The majority of patients had stage IA (67%) versus stage IB (21%) or stage II (11%) disease. The majority of patients (63%) received adjuvant treatment: vaginal brachytherapy only (14%); whole pelvic radiation therapy only (16%); chemotherapy only (n = 13, 9%); combination chemotherapy and vaginal brachytherapy (15%); combination chemotherapy and whole pelvic radiation (9%). 52 patients (37%) received no adjuvant therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 48.0 months (95% CI 32.7–80.9). On multivariable analysis for OS, advancing age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–1.08, p < 0.001), higher stage (stage IB: HR 1.64, 95% CI 0.91–2.95, p = 0.10; stage II: HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.51–6.13, p = 0.002), and the presence of a rhabdomyosarcoma component (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.02–2.70, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with worse OS. Conclusions: Advancing age, stage, and the presence of a rhabdomyosarcoma component were all associated with worse OS in patients with early stage uterine carcinosarcoma.

To assess ICA-1s as a possible therapeutic, in-vivo studies using a murine model were performed. ICA-1s was tested for stability in blood serum and results demonstrated that ICA-1s was stable in human plasma at 25 and 37°C over a course of 2 h. Toxicity of ICA-1s was tested for both acute and subacute exposure. The acute exposure showed patient surviving after 48 h of doses ranging from 5 to 5000 mg/kg. Subacute tests exposed the patients to 14 days of treatment and were followed by serum and tissue collection. Aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, troponin, and C-reactive protein serum levels were measured to assess organ function. ICA-1s in plasma serum was measured over the course of 24 h for both oral and intravenous treatments. Heart, liver, kidney, and brain tissues were analyzed for accumulation of ICA-1s. Finally, athymic nude mice were xenografted with DU-145 prostate cancer cells. After tumors reached 0.2 cm 2, they were either treated with ICA-1s or left as control and measured for 30 days or until the tumor reached 2 cm 2. Results showed tumors in treated mice grew at almost half the rate as untreated tumors, showing a significant reduction in growth.

Dopamine (DA) central nervous system neurotransmitters serve an important role in cognition, and changes in DA could potentially explain impaired cognition associated with chemotherapy. Therefore, our objective was to assess in vivo dopaminergic dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS) of a group of female breast cancer survivors with cognitive impairment following chemotherapy. Methods: Twenty-eight women reporting chemobrain were recruited for this study and compared to 22 healthy reference women. Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding ratio was determined by 99m Tc-TRODAT-1 (a highly selective radiotracer for DAT in the dorsal striatum) single-photon emission computed tomography and a quantitative evaluation was obtained by DatQUANT™ software (GE Healthcare). The DAT binding ratio (BR DAT ) in the patient and control groups was compared using the Student’s t test, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to compare age, years of schooling and BR DAT . The relationship between continuous variables, such as cognitive impairment and BR DAT was assessed using Pearson correlation test. Results: There was a difference in BR DAT between the chemobrain patients and control group. Patients had statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) lower concentrations of the radiopharmaceutical in the striatum. Conclusions: We identified a significant dopaminergic decrease in all regions of the dorsal striatum within the patients reporting cognitive dysfunction after chemotherapy.

In part 2 (dose-expansion cohort), 12 patients with pretreated, metastatic TNBC received PF-06647263 at the RP2D to further evaluate tumor response and overall safety. PF-06647263 QW administration (n, 23) was better tolerated than the Q3W regimen (n, 25) with only 1 DLT reported (thrombocytopenia). The most common AEs with the QW regimen (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mucosal inflammation, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea) were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The MTD was not estimated. PF-06647263 exposures increased in a dose-related manner across the doses evaluated. The RP2D was determined to be 0.015 mg/kg QW. Six (10%) patients achieved a confirmed partial response and 22 (36.7%) patients had stable disease. No correlations were observed between tumor responses and EFNA4 expression levels.

Methods: Between January and May 2018, 77 oncology clinicians (52 physicians, 16 pharmacists, and 9 advanced practice providers) completed a survey covering three domains: clinician understanding, prescription preferences, and patient involvement. An in-depth interview was designed based on themes identified in the first 50 surveys: cost, safety and efficacy, patient preference, and disease stage. Participants were chosen to participate in the interview based on outlying responses to survey questions. Results: When asked to define a biosimilar, 74% (57/77) of respondents could not give a satisfactory definition, and 40.3% (31/77) considered a biosimilar the same as a generic drug. The most important factor in biosimilar prescription was safety and efficacy (4.51 out of 5) followed closely by cost differences (4.34 out of 5). A 40% increase (53.2–94.8%) in clinicians’ prescribing likelihood was seen after a biosimilar is designated as interchangeable. Participants in this study were split regarding the importance of shared decision-making with patients [50.7% (39/77) important or extremely important, 39.0% (30/77) somewhat or not at all important]. Clinicians were also split concerning the role that pharmacists should play in the decision to prescribe or substitute biosimilars. Conclusion: Understanding of biosimilars is low, and educational needs are high. The information that clinicians deem important to assess, such as safety, efficacy and cost, will need to be provided before they are comfortable prescribing biosimilars. © The Author(s), 2019.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059856476

This study investigated whether lung function decline and survival associates with adaptive immunity in patients with IPF, specifically the expression of checkpoint molecules ICOS, CD28 and PD-1 on circulating CD4 T cells. Clinical data, blood samples and pulmonary function tests were collected prospectively and longitudinally from 59 patients with IPF over a study period of 5 years. Patients were followed until death, lung transplantation, or study end, and cell surface expression of CD45RO, CD28, ICOS, and PD-1 was measured on CD4 T cells via flow cytometry. Repeated measures of ICOS and CD28 on CD4 T cells revealed significant associations between declining ICOS and CD28 expression, and declining lung function parameters FVC and DLCO, independent of age, sex, race, smoking history, or immunosuppressant use. Strikingly, patients in the highest quintile of ICOS at study entry had markedly improved survival, while those with low CD28 fared poorly. No change in PD-1 expression was found. Analysis of ICOS and CD28 from the first blood draw identified three populations of IPF patients; those at high risk for early death, those with intermediate risk, and those at low risk. These results highlight the role of T cell mediated immunity in IPF survival, finding the assessment of two T cell stimulatory checkpoint molecules, CD28 and ICOS, was sufficient to discriminate three distinct survival trajectories over 5 years of patient follow up. © 2019 The Authors","Final",Open Access,2-s2.0-85061124824

Little is known about whether obesity is associated with a lower incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, another important preventive care service for adolescent girls and young women. The objective of this study was to determine if adolescent girls and young women with obesity are less likely to receive HPV vaccination compared with individuals with normal weight. Methods: We examined whether HPV vaccination was associated with obesity status in women aged 9–30 years surveyed from 2009 to 2016 by the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Results from logistic and linear regression models were adjusted for age, race, income, insurance status, self-reported health, and health care use, accounting for the weighted survey design. Results: The final cohort included 5,517 women. Overall, 32.9% of participants reported vaccination, with a mean age at vaccination of 15.8 years. Adolescent girls and young women with obesity were less likely to report vaccination; the adjusted odds ratio of vaccination was 0.79 (p =.01) compared with normal weight women. Among those vaccinated, the age at vaccination was significantly older for women with obesity, 16.3 years compared with 15.2 years (p =.002), but there was no difference in the completion of the vaccination series rate by obesity. Conclusions: Adolescent girls and young women with obesity were less likely to report HPV vaccination and, if they were vaccinated, received the vaccination at a later age. © 2018 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health","Final",,2-s2.0-85056400372

Cellular metabolism and cell behavior, however, can be significantly different in 2D cultures from that in vivo. As a result, there are emerging interests in integrating noninvasive, quantitative imaging techniques of NAD(P)H with in vivo-like three-dimensional (3D) models. The overall features and metabolic responses of the murine breast cancer cells line 4T1 in 2D cultures were compared with those in 3D collagen matrix using integrated optical micro-spectroscopy. The metabolic responses to two novel compounds, MD1 and TPPBr, that target metabolism by disrupting monocarboxylate transporters or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), respectively, were investigated using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2P-FLIM) of intracellular NAD(P)H in 2D and 3D cultures. 4T1 cells exhibit distinct behaviors in a collagenous 3D matrix from those in 2D culture, forming anastomosing multicellular networks and spherical acini in 3D culture, as opposed to simple flattened epithelial plaques in 2D culture. The cellular NAD(P)H in 3D collagen matrix exhibits a longer fluorescence lifetime as compared with 2D culture, which is attributed to an enhanced population of enzyme-bound NAD(P)H in the 3D culture. TPPBr induces mitochondrial hyperpolarization in 2D culture of 4T1 cells along with an enhanced free NAD(P)H population, which suggest an interference with OXPHOS. In contrast, 2P-FLIM of cellular NAD(P)H revealed an enhanced autofluorescence lifetime in 3D 4T1 cultures after MD1 treatment as compared with MD1-treated 2D culture and the control 3D culture. Physical and chemical microenvironmental signaling are critical factors in understanding how therapeutic compounds target cancer cells by disrupting their metabolic pathways.

Nowadays, two methods are used for the identification of SLN: blue dye method aiding visually and radioactive dye using gamma detector. A wide range of gamma probe systems with different design and performance are used in intra-operative surgery. The performance of the probes is evaluated by some parameters such as sensitivity, spatial resolution, angular resolution, and shielding efficiency. Methods: In this study, we simulated a gamma probe system, SURGEOGUIDE II based on CsI(Tl) scintillator, a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), and a tungsten collimator, using the MCNP4C Monte Carlo (MC) method and comparing with experimental measurement. Finally we modeled a series of probe with various crystal material, crystal length, and collimator hole length to evaluate the sensitivity and the spatial resolution in order to propose the optimal configuration. Results: The sensitivity of the system was measured as 2040 cps/MBq in 30 mm distance from the source. The spatial resolution and angular resolution were 43 mm and 70° at the same distance, respectively. Sensitivity at 30 mm distance from the probe head was the highest for BGO crystal and was the lowest for NaI crystals. The sensitivity and spatial resolution have also been changed by increasing the length of the crystal to a certain amount and then remained constant. Conclusion: The results showed that the best choice for crystal was CdTe and CsI and the best length for CsI crystal in this type of the systems was 10 mm long. Also, based on the specific application, special probe should be designed taking the length of the collimator hole into consideration. © 2019 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Methods: Among the 225 patients randomly assigned to trastuzumab/pertuzumab concurrently or sequentially with an anthracycline-containing regimen or concurrently with an anthracycline-free regimen in the Tryphaena trial, we determined the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at baseline in 213 patients, of which 126 demonstrated a pathological complete response (pCR; ypT0/is ypN0), with 28 demonstrating event-free survival (EFS) events. We investigated associations between baseline TIL percentage and either pCR or EFS after adjusting for clinicopathological characteristics using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively. To understand TIL biology, we evaluated associations between baseline TILs and baseline tumor gene expression data (800 gene set by NanoString) in a subset of 173 patients. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among the patients with measurable TILs at baseline, the median level was 14.1% (interquartile range = 7.1%-32.4%). After adjusting for clinicopathological characteristics, baseline percentage TIL was not associated with pCR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for every 10-percentage unit increase in TILs = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95 to 1.31, P = .17). At a median follow-up of 4.7 years, for every increase in baseline TILs of 10%, there was a 25% reduction in the hazard for an EFS event (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56 to 1.00, P = .05) after adjusting for baseline clinicopathological characteristics and pCR. Additionally, genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and T-cell inhibition such as SNAIL1, ZEB1, NOTCH3, and B7-H3 were statistically significantly inversely correlated with percentage TIL. Conclusions: Baseline TIL percentage provides independent prognostic information in patients treated with trastuzumab/pertuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The results provide disease-level cost-effectiveness ratios for comparing changes in medical care spending to changes in health outcomes for patients diagnosed with one of the conditions. This study has two key findings: First, dollars spent on medical care can be a source of high value creation, and such investment should continue. Second, significant variability in value exists across diseases, which highlights the need for disease-specific spending approaches. © 2019 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.","Final",,2-s2.0-85059687423

However, effective therapeutics for ccRCC are lacking. Novel biomarkers could provide critical information when determining prognoses for patients with ccRCC. In this study, we sought to determine if the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase (TEK) could be a potential novel prognostic biomarker for ccRCC. TEK, originally identified as an endothelial cell-specific receptor, plays an important role in the modulation of vasculogenesis and remodeling. Altered TEK expression has been observed in tumor tissues (e.g., oral squamous cell carcinomas, leukemia) and breast, gastric and thyroid cancers. However, the role of TEK in ccRCC remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Differential TEK expression between non-metastatic (stage M0) and metastatic (stage M1) ccRCC patient cohorts was determined from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Furthermore, TEK expression was assessed as a prognostic factor using the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of Uno’s C-index, the AUC value of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) at 5 years, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that the downregulation of TEK expression was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with ccRCC with good discrimination (p<0.0001 and p=0.0044 for the TGCA and ICGC cohorts, respectively). Analyses of C-indices and receiver operating characteristic AUC values further support this discriminative ability. Moreover, multivariate analyses showed the prognostic significance of TEK expression levels (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although additional clinical investigations will be needed, our results suggest that TEK is a potential biomarker for ccRCC. © 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

International treatment guidelines recommend induction therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine. This antifungal combination is most effective, but unfortunately flucytosine is expensive and unavailable where the burden of disease is greatest. Where unavailable, guidelines recommend treatment with amphotericin and fluconazole, but this is less effective, with mortality rates of 40-50%. Faster rates of clearance of yeast from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with better outcomes-improving the potency of antifungal therapy is likely to be an effective strategy to improve survival. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to treat breast cancer, has anti-cryptococcal activity, appearing synergistic when combined in vitro with amphotericin, and fungicidal when combined with fluconazole. It is concentrated in the brain and macrophages, off-patent, cheap and widely available. We designed a randomized trial to deliver initial efficacy and safety data for tamoxifen combined with amphotericin and fluconazole. Method: A phase II, open-label, randomized (1:1) controlled trial of tamoxifen (300mg/day) combined with amphotericin (1mg/kg/day) and fluconazole (800mg/day) for the first 2 weeks therapy for HIV infected or uninfected adults with cryptococcal meningitis. The study recruits at Cho Ray Hospital and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The primary end point is Early Fungicidal Activity (EFA-the rate of yeast clearance from CSF), over the first two weeks of treatment. 50 patients will be recruited providing ≈80% and 90% power to detect a difference in the EFA of-0.11 or-0.13 log10CFU/ml/day, respectively. Discussion: The results of the study will inform the decision to proceed to a larger trial powered to mortality. The size of effect detectable has previously been associated with reduced mortality from this devastating disease.

In this study we aimed to assess if simple or subcutaneous mastectomy for prophylaxis affects perioperative outcomes compared with resection performed for biopsy proven malignancy. Materials and Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for subjects who underwent simple or subcutaneous mastectomy between 2007 and 2012. Patient demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and postoperative complications were analyzed. Results: Of the 30,803 patients, 30,644 (99.5%) underwent therapeutic mastectomy and 159 (0.5%) underwent prophylactic mastectomy. Subjects who underwent prophylactic surgery were more likely to be younger (45 vs. 58 years; P <.01) and white (134 [84%] vs. 20,647 [67%]; P <.01). Surgery time was significantly greater in the prophylactic group (265 vs. 166 minutes; P <.01). There was no significant difference in mortality between groups. There was a trend toward greater 30-day morbidity (15 [9%] vs. 1835 [6%]; P =.09) and occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT; 2 [1%] vs. 74 [0.2%]; P =.06) in those who underwent prophylactic mastectomy. After age adjustment, the prophylactic group showed a nearly sixfold increase in DVT (odds ratio [OR], 5.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-24.22), which persisted when controlling for surgery time (OR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.18-20.86).

Methods: The clinical information and molecular profiles (including gene expression array, non-silent somatic mutation, DNA methylation and protein expression) were downloaded from The Cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Electronic medical records were abstracted from Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) for analysis as well. Grade II–IV Glioma patients were all included. Results: 931 Whites and 64 African-American glioma patients from TCGA were analyzed. African-American with Karnofsky performance score (KPS) ≥ 80 have significantly lower risk of death than similar white Grade IV Glioblastoma (GBM) patients [HR (95% CI) = 0.47 (0.23, 0.98), P = 0.0444, C-index = 0.68]. Therefore, we further compared gene expression profiles between African-American GBM patients and Whites with KPS ≥ 80. Extrapolation of genes significantly associated with increased African-American patient survival revealed a set of 13 genes with a possible role in this association, including elevated expression of genes previously identified as increased in African-American breast and colon cancer patients (e.g. CRYBB2). Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed retinoic acid (RA) metabolism as a pathway significantly upregulated in African-American GBM patients who survive longer than Whites (Z-score = − 2.10, Adjusted P-value = 0.0449). Conclusions: African Americans have prolonged survival with glioma which is influenced only by initial KPS score. Genes previously associated with both racial disparities in cancer and pathways associated with RA metabolism may play an important role in glioma etiology. In the future exploration of these genes and pathways may inform novel therapies for this incurable disease. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article in Press",,2-s2.0-85060936888

It is inexpensive, effective, and generally safe. When clinical response is inadequate, biological therapies are commonly used in combination with MTX. However, biological agents have safety concerns (i.e. infections, malignancy) and the addition of a biologic agent is expensive, making strategies to improve MTX efficacy important. Inhibition of pathways of folate metabolism involving purine metabolism by MTX, have been traditionally emphasized as important in MTX efficacy. However, inhibition MTX catabolism may also be important. MTX is irreversibly hydroxylated to form 7-hydroxy methotrexate (7-OH-MTX) by aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) (AOX). Catabolism of MTX to 7-OH-MTX is the first metabolic process imposed on an oral dose of MTX and will alter subsequent interactions of MTX with other enzymes. 7-OH-MTX is less potent than MTX in the treatment of rat adjuvant arthritis. RA patients with a low capacity to catabolize MTX to 7-OH-MTX do better clinically than individuals who are rapid formers of 7-OH-MTX. Therefore, altering the catabolism of MTX may be an innovative way to improve MTX efficacy. Raloxifene is a FDA-approved therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis and for the reduction of invasive breast cancers but has no known activity in RA. Raloxifene is a potent inhibitor of human liver AOX. Postmenopausal women with RA frequently have low bone mineral density and would be candidates for raloxifene and MTX combination therapy. The effect of raloxifene on MTX metabolism has never been studied. Our hypothesis is that in postmenopausal women with RA and osteoporosis treated with MTX and raloxifene, the inhibition of AOX with resultant decreased formation of 7-OH MTX; will increase MTX levels and improve MTX efficacy. This hypothesis could be studied in an open-label, proof of concept clinical study in individuals before and after the addition of raloxifene. Red blood cell MTX and 7-OH-MTX levels and RA disease activity (DAS28) would be measured. In possible future studies, there are dietary substances, as supplements, (e.g. epigallocatechin gallate in green tea and resveratrol) which inhibit human liver AOX which could be evaluated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Final",,2-s2.0-85055038913

In continuation of our efforts in identifying the new small molecule antiviral and anticancer agents, we identified chalcones as potent antiviral and anticancer agents. OBJECTIVE: With the aim of identifying the broad acting antiviral and anticancer agents, we discovered substituted aryl/heteroaryl derived thienyl chalcones as antiviral and anticancer agents. METHOD: A focused set of thienyl chalcone derivaties II-VI was screened for selected viruses Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Dengue virus 2 (DENV2), Influenza A (H1N1) virus, MERS coronavirus, Poliovirus 1 (PV 1), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Tacaribe virus (TCRV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and Zika virus (ZIKV) using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) antiviral screening program. Additionally, a cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has been screened for 60 human cancer cell lines using the Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) of NCI. RESULTS: All thienyl chalcone derivatives II-VI displayed moderate to excellent antiviral activity towards several viruses tested. Compounds V and VI were turned out be active compounds towards human cytomegalovirus for both normal strain (AD169) as well as resistant isolate (GDGr K17). Particularly, cyano derivative V showed very high potency (EC50: <0.05 µM) towards AD169 strain of HCMV compared to standard drug Ganciclovir (EC50: 0.12 µM). Additionally, it showed moderate activity in the secondary assay (AD169; EC50: 2.30 µM). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV displayed high potency towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Tacaribe virus (TCRV) towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV is nearly 28 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: 0.39 µg/ml) and nearly 17 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: 0.71 μg/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 11 µg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 12 µg/ml; neutral red assay). It is nearly 12 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: >1 µg/ml) and nearly 8 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: >1.3 µg/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 12 µg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 9.9 µg/ml; neutral red assay) towards Tacaribe virus (TCRV). Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has shown strong growth inhibitory activity towards three major cancers (colon, breast, and leukemia) cell lines and moderate growth inhibition shown towards other cancer cell lines screened. CONCLUSION: Compounds V and VI were demonstrated viral inhibition towards Human cytomegalovirus, whereas cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV towards Rift Valley fever virus and Tacaribe virus. Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has displayed very good cytotoxicity against colon, breast and leukemia cell lines in vitro.

Specific markers would enable isolation of these stem cells, thereby promoting advancements in regenerative medicine for the treatment of endometrial diseases and dysfunctions. We sought to investigate the regenerative ability of human endometrial positive for sushi domain containing 2/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (SUSD2 + /ICAM1 + ) cells and Side Population cell lines in a xenograft mice model. The injection of total endometrial cell suspensions and Side Population cell lines under kidney capsules induced neoformation of human endometrium verified by the presence of typical endometrial markers (vimentin, cytokeratin 18, and progesterone receptor) by immunofluorescence. Total endometrial cell types promoted a better reconstitution in comparison to injecting ICAM1 + and SUSD2 + cells alone. The endometrial fraction is probably acting as a niche, resulting in increased reconstruction efficiency of pure fractions. Human engrafted cells were localized near blood vessels and induced the proliferation of surrounding cells.
